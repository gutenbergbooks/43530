<p class="ac lg150">PREFACE</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

  <p>The subject dealt with in this volume, so far as the writer knows, is
  virgin soil; no book has appeared, here or abroad, on the subject of
  stallwork. Abroad, the great mass of stallwork has perished; sometimes at
  the hands of pious vandals, often through neglect, more often still
  through indifference to or active dislike of mediæval art. In the
  stallwork of Belgium not a single tabernacled canopy remains; in France
  and Italy the great majority of the Gothic stalls have been replaced by
  woodwork of the Classical design that was dear to the seventeenth and
  eighteenth centuries; only in Spain can the wealth and splendour of
  English stallwork be rivalled. In England a great amount of magnificent
  stallwork still remains; on the stallwork indeed and the concomitant
  screens time and labour and money were lavished without stint in the last
  two centuries of Gothic art. Hitherto, however, this important department
  of English mediæval design has almost wholly lacked recognition and
  appreciation; attention had not been called to its value in the study of
  artistic woodwork, and even the most splendid examples of this branch of
  English art have been passed over with uncomprehending indifference. Yet
  it is no overstatement to say that there is nothing in this country more
  consummate in design or execution than the stallwork of Lancaster,
  Chester, Ripon, and Manchester. To most of the readers of this volume the
  illustrations which have been here gathered together will come as a
  revelation of beauty and interest. It is to be hoped that the book will
  help to inform those who are heritors of a great artistic past, will make
  them proud of their heritage as Englishmen, and faithful to preserve it
  and hand it on in turn unimpaired to their successors. The art is in the
  main English <!-- Page viii --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="pageviii"></a>{viii}</span>art, as English as the timber in which
  it is wrought, and deserves the attention of all English-speaking people
  the world over, who inherit equally with ourselves the good things that
  remain from the England of old.</p>

  <p>This book, like the others in the series, owes much of any value it
  may possess to the generous and ready co-operation of many lovers of
  mediæval art. For photographs and drawings the writer is indebted to the
  Rev. G. B. Atkinson, Mr A. W. Anderson, A.R.I.B.A., Mr J. H. Bayley, Mr
  C. E. S. Beloe, Dr G. G. Buckley, Dr Oscar Clark, Mr F. H. Crossley, Rev.
  E. Hermitage Day, Mr W. Marriott Dodson, Mr G. C. Druce, Mr A. Gardner,
  Mr S. Gardner, Mr G. F. Gillham, Mr C. Goulding, Mr Charles de Gruchy, Mr
  F. J. Hall, Mr J. F. Hamilton, Mr P. Mainwaring Johnston, F.S.A.,
  Professor Lethaby, Mr W. Maitland, Mr Hugh M&lsquo;Lachlan, A.R.I.B.A.,
  Mr C. F. Nunneley, Mr H. Plowman, Rev. G. H. Poole, Mr Alan Potter, Miss
  E. K. Prideaux, Rev. G. W. Saunders, Mr S. Smith, Mr J. C. Stenning, Mr
  F. R. Taylor, Mr G. H. Tyndall, Mr G. H. Widdows, A.R.I.B.A., Rev. W. E.
  Wigfall, Mr A. J. Wilson, Mr E. W. M. Wonnacott, F.S.I. The writer is
  indebted to the Society of Antiquaries and to the Wiltshire Archæological
  Society for the use of original drawings.</p>

  <p>The revision of the proofs has kindly been undertaken by Rev. R. A.
  Davis and Rev. C. A. Norris; to the former and to the Rev. A. Bayley the
  writer is indebted for many valuable suggestions with respect to changes
  of orientation and the arrangements of chancels. The illustrations are
  reproduced by the Grout Engraving Company. The text is preceded by a
  bibliography and lists of measured drawings, and is followed by an index
  to places and illustrations and a subject index. <!-- Page ix --><span

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER I</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">STALLS IN CHURCHES OF MONKS AND CANONS</p>

  <p>In all churches of monks and canons, whether secular canons or canons
  following the Augustinian, Premonstratensian, Gilbertine or other Rule,
  stalls were placed in the choir. These stalls were occupied either by the
  monks or by the canons and their deputies and by men singers and
  choristers; there was also a limited lay use. The stalls had seats;
  these, however, were occupied for but short portions of a service: during
  the greater part of each service the occupants of the stalls stood or
  knelt. The seats turned up on a pivot, as may be seen by comparing those
  of Beverley St Mary (<a href="#page2">2</a>) with those of Christchurch
  (<a href="#page2">2</a>); and when they were turned up, a small ledge
  underneath the seat gave a little support to any one standing in the
  stall; for his comfort also there was usually a circular projecting ledge
  behind him, against which he could lean his back; <i>e.g.</i>, at
  Beverley St Mary, but not at Balsham (<a href="#page3">3</a>); also he
  could rest his hands on the shoulders of the stall, when standing, as at
  Beverley St Mary and Balsham. An elbow was often provided lower down, for
  use when he was seated; as in the two above-mentioned churches. Above was
  usually some form of canopy, varying from a cornice of slight projection,
  as at Balsham, to such tabernacled spires as those of Beverley Minster
  (<a href="#page27">27</a>). In front of the stalls, except sometimes the
  front stall occupied by choir boys, was a desk for service books. Every
  part of the stallwork was carefully designed; and parochial, collegiate
  and monastic stalls alike were constantly growing in importance and
  loveliness up to the Dissolution. <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>The upper shoulder was usually simply molded, as at Beverley St Mary;
  it rarely took the form of an animal, as at Balsham. Usually the lower
  elbow was simply molded, as in Beverley Minster (<a href="#page3">3</a>);
  sometimes it terminated in a mask, an animal or foliage; as in the lower
  range of stalls at Christchurch (<a href="#page2">2</a>) and at Cartmel
  (<a href="#page80">80</a>); in Beverley St Mary there is an angel in
  front of each of the lower elbows. As a rule, the projecting ends of the
  elbows were carried down as supports, <i>e.g.</i>, at Beverley Minster;
  sometimes, however, a shaft or pair of shafts is introduced, as at
  Balsham, Beverley St Mary, Hereford All Saints (<a
  href="#page44">44</a>); Dunblane (<a href="#page67">67</a>) and
  Christchurch (<a href="#page2">2</a>), where they are highly enriched.
  The upper part of the back of the stall is usually panelled; <i>e.g.</i>,
  Winchester (<a href="#page35">35</a>), Chichester (<a
  href="#page36">36</a>). Hereford All Saints (<a href="#page44">44</a>),
  Balsham (<a href="#page3">3</a>). In the sixteenth century, however,
  panelling became less common; at Dunblane the stall backs are plain (<a
  href="#page67">67</a>); at Cartmel they are filled in with scrolls and
  fretwork (<a href="#page80">80</a>); at King's College, Cambridge, with
  coats of arms (<a href="#page78">78</a>); at Christchurch with carvings
  of masks and animals (<a href="#page76">76</a>). In Wren's church at
  Christ Church, Newgate Street, the panels of the stalls have fine
  carvings of St Matthew (<a href="#page4">4</a>), St Mark (<a
  href="#page4">4</a>), St Luke (<a href="#page4">4</a>), St John (<a
  href="#page4">4</a>), the Last Supper and other subjects. The desks also
  usually have traceried panelling in front and at their ends, which is
  often of much importance in helping to fix the date of the stalls;
  <i>e.g.</i>, at Chester (<a href="#page24">24</a>), Manchester (<a
  href="#page6">6</a>), Trunch (<a href="#page85">85</a>) and Stowlangtoft
  (<a href="#page91">91</a>). At Lincoln the panels of the lowest rows of
  desks contain alternately the figures of a king and of an angel with a
  musical instrument (<a href="#page5">5</a>). On the stall ends was
  lavished the best artistic talent of the day; there are magnificent
  examples at Chester (<a href="#page9">9</a>), Ripon (<a
  href="#page8">8</a>) and Beverley Minster (<a href="#page7">7</a>); very
  fine also are those in Bishop Tunstall's chapel in Durham castle. On the
  example from Manchester is an impaled shield, displaying on the dexter
  half the letters <b>I. B.</b> (<i>i.e.</i>, John Beswick, donor <!-- Page
  6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"></a>{6}</span>of the northern
  stalls), a cross intervening, and beneath on a chevron seven nails or
  cloves. The sinister half is occupied by a demi-virgin issuing out of an
  orle of clouds. The illustrations from Ripon shew the stalls of the
  Archbishop of York and the Mayor of the city (<a href="#page8">8</a>). In
  the former the poppy head takes the form of an elephant holding a man in
  his trunk, and carrying a castle filled with soldiery; in front of the
  elephant is a centaur (renewed); below is a large mitre studded with
  precious stones (<i>mitra preciosa</i>) above a shield charged with the
  three stars of St Wilfrid, the patron saint of the Minster, and supported
  by two angels, between whom is a scroll with the date 1494. Attached to
  the latter is a collared baboon; beneath is a shield charged with the
  arms of the see of York, two keys in saltire. Of the two examples
  illustrated from Chester (<a href="#page10">10</a>), one represents the
  Annunciation; the other is a most elaborate Jesse Tree (<a
  href="#page9">9</a>).</p>

  <p>The ends of the desks usually terminate in poppy heads; at <!-- Page 7
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"></a>{7}</span>Chester, Ripon,
  Manchester and Beverley there are magnificent examples. At Blythburgh,
  Suffolk (<a href="#page11">11</a>), is a foliated poppy head with a lion
  in front; in front of the desks and those on the opposite side of the
  chancel are niches containing statuettes of the apostles; these stalls
  were brought into the chancel from the Hopton chapel, which is said to
  have been founded in 1452; the Hopton arms appear on the bench end. There
  are interesting desks in the great church of Walpole St Peter, Norfolk
  (<a href="#page12">12</a>). When Edmund the King of the East Saxons was
  shot to death by the Danes and afterwards beheaded, his head was guarded
  by a wolf; the scene is depicted here and up and down all East Anglia;
  the whole story is told in six foliated capitals in the north porch of
  Wells cathedral, which is early in the thirteenth century. At
  Stowlangtoft, Suffolk, the poppy head consists of a vested priest reading
  at a lectern or altar (<a href="#page91">91</a>).</p>

  <p>Besides stalls for monks, clergy and singers, benches or <!-- Page 8
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>{8}</span>stalls are
  sometimes found for members of a church gild, as at Fressingfield,
  Suffolk; or those now used by almsmen at Etwall, Derbyshire, on which the
  date 1635 is inscribed; the Jacobean armchair motif is prominent;
  nevertheless there is Gothic cusping at the back; pegs are thoughtfully
  provided for the almsmen's hats (<a href="#page13">13</a>).</p>

  <p>The stalls are generally constructed very solidly. The ends of a row
  are inserted in a strong sill, into which the standards for the supports
  of the book board are also inserted. The elbows are in one solid piece
  and are framed into the backs of the stalls; they are further secured by
  the heavy capping above, which admirably connects and strengthens the
  work. On either side the elbow is sunk to enable the seat to be turned up
  on its hinges and to afford it support when down. The seats are generally
  about an inch in thickness, the misericords projecting about five inches.
  As the entire seat is got out of one solid piece of wood, the time
  expended on each must have been very considerable; and difficulties in
  the grain without doubt frequently added immensely to the labour. The
  work is often cut across the grain and worked with much skill. Great care
  was taken in some instances to match the wood; <i>e.g.</i>, in the
  panelled backs of the stalls in Henry the Seventh's chapel.<a

  <p>The construction of the tabernacled canopies is well seen in the set
  of illustrations from Chester cathedral. In Lincoln Minster, where they
  are of somewhat simpler type, they may be described as follows. The
  canopies are hexagonal, supported on shafts, which have clustered niches
  above their proper capitals; the stalls of the Chancellor and Treasurer,
  which are at the extreme east on either side of the choir, have winged
  seraphs in their capitals. The niches have ogee canopies bowing forward
  in front of their true gables, with various small heads and faces on the
  hip-knobs. A second story of the canopy contains a niche, square in plan,
  but set lozenge wise, covered with a lofty pinnacle, and flanked by open
  screenwork with high flying buttresses, nearly all of which have lost
  their crockets. All the niches originally contained statues. The loss of
  these greatly damaged the general effect&mdash;the alternation of light
  and shadow, the play of line and the added mass. Now that the statues
  have been replaced, the general character intended to be impressed on the
  design can be well realised (<a href="#page52">52</a>).<a name="NtA_2"

  <p>The cost of woodwork so elaborate as that of the later stalls,
  especially those with tabernacled canopies, was very great. At Wells the
  stalls, destroyed in 1848&mdash;another example of
  "restoration"&mdash;were begun in 1325; each resident canon paid 30
  <i>solidi</i> for his own stall, and the stalls were to cost altogether
  £1,200. The non-resident canons, having subscribed little or nothing,
  were ordered in 1337 to make up a deficit of £200 for the completion of
  the stalls.<a name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> As the number
  of stalls needed at Wells would be about sixty, it follows that the
  expenditure on each stall was to be £20, which in our money might be
  £300; giving a grand total of about £18,000. The stalls at Amiens number
  116, and were put up between 1508 and 1522. Viollet-le-Duc computes that
  in 1866 they could not have been put up for less than £20,000.<a
  name="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> But they do not possess
  tabernacled spirelets, <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page12"></a>{12}</span>having a comparatively simple horizontal
  cresting. At Windsor in 1483 six canopies cost £40; thus sixty would cost
  £400, or in our money about £4,800; <i>i.e.</i>, about £80 each; but this
  expenditure relates to the canopies only, and not to the stalls or the
  misericords, or the lower stalls and desks; if the cost of these be
  added, the cost might be as great as at Wells. Few probably realise the
  vast expenditure which our forefathers gladly undertook not only on the
  building but the equipment of their churches: in a church of the first
  rank, such as Exeter cathedral, the cost of the altar, reredos, sedilia,
  bishop's throne, canopied stalls and pavement would hardly fall short of
  £30,000 of our money; which is exclusive of the cost of the masonry,
  vault, timber roof and leading, and stained glass.</p>

  <p>As regards the arrangement of the stalls, as many as there were room
  for were placed at the back of the choir screen, usually two or three on
  either side of the western doorway of the choir. The juxtaposition of
  screen and stalls gives some very beautiful effects, <i>e.g.</i>, at
  Chaddesden, Derbyshire (<a href="#page99">99</a>); still more so is this
  the case when screen and stalls are of the same design, as at Chester (<a
  href="#page24">24</a>), where the screen was designed in accordance with
  the stallwork by Sir Gilbert Scott. <!-- Page 13 --><span

    <p style="text-align:center">Etwall</p>
  </div>

  <p>As to the <i>place of honour</i> in the stalls, that raises some
  interesting points. There were no less than three places of honour in a
  chancel; in each case the place of honour was to the right, because it
  was written in the Psalms, "Sit thou on my <i>right hand</i>"; and
  because of the words of the Creed, "sitteth on the <i>right hand</i> of
  God the Father Almighty"; first, the right hand or north side of the
  altar, facing the west; second, the first seat to the right, or on the
  south side, of the entrance to the chancel through the choir doorway;
  thirdly, the extreme right to the east, or nearest the altar, of the
  south row of stalls. In the sanctuary the Lord Christ was conceived to be
  in real, corporeal presence, face to face with His people, His right hand
  to the north, His left hand to the south. In the sanctuary therefore the
  place of honour was on the north; and to this day when a bishop visits a
  parish church, his chair is placed north of the altar; the gospel also is
  read on the north side, the epistle on the south. In several churches in
  Derbyshire there are stone "gospel-desks" affixed to the north wall of
  the chancel. Turning to the choir, things are different. When the
  procession enters the choir from the nave through the screen doorway, the
  right of the return stalls is the place of honour. Here in a cathedral of
  the old foundation, <i>i.e.</i>, one which has always been served by
  secular canons, such as Lincoln, Wells, Hereford, the dean sits on the
  right, and the subdean or the precentor on the left of the gangway. In a
  monastic church the abbot sat on the south, the prior on the north side.
  But sometimes a monastic church, <i>e.g.</i>, Ely, Winchester, Norwich,
  was also the cathedral of a bishop, who was <i>ipso facto</i> abbot. In
  such a church the bishop should sit on the right-hand side of the return
  stall; at Ely there is no bishop's throne, and he occupies that position
  to this day. <!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Where a bishop's throne was erected, it was placed on the south side
  of the choir, which is ecclesiastically always favoured more than the
  north. Of the stalls on the south side of a choir the one most to the
  right is of course the easternmost; and it is here that the ancient
  thrones remain of the bishops of Exeter, St David's and Durham. Again,
  even if it was not a cathedral church, there were occasions when it was
  not convenient for an abbot to be so remote from the altar as the return
  stalls, <i>e.g.</i>, at certain portions of the Mass; for such occasions
  alternative seats were provided for the abbot and prior; the former
  occupying the easternmost stall on the south side, the prior that on the
  north. At Peterborough there is evidence that the abbot's seat was on the
  south, at the east end of the choir, near the <i>ostium
  presbyterii</i>.<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> At Ripon
  the bishop occupies the easternmost stall in the south side, which from
  the carving of a mitre at the back appears to have been originally
  assigned to the Archbishop of York; the place of honour opposite is
  occupied by the Wakeman or Mayor of the city.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER II</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">POSITION, NUMBER AND ARRANGEMENT OF STALLS</p>

  <p>The history of the changes of position of the stalls of the clergy is
  one of the most curious and least understood episodes in ecclesiology; it
  may be worth while therefore to go into it somewhat at length, and to
  begin at the beginning. As regards what was at all times the main service
  in the church, the Mass, there were two conditions which it was desirable
  to bear in mind in church planning. One was that the celebrant should
  face to the East; the other that the congregation should face to the
  East. In the earliest Christian days the latter was most often
  disregarded. The earliest arrangement, normally, of a Christian church
  was that the sanctuary, containing the altar, should be to the west, and
  that the laity should be in the nave occupying the eastern portion of the
  church. At this time the western portion of the church consisted of a
  semicircular apse. This apse had a double function. On the chord of it
  was placed the High altar (in the earliest days it was the only altar);
  and to the west of it stood the celebrant facing east and facing the
  congregation, as he does to this day at St Ambrogio, Milan, and other
  churches which retain this primitive plan. Behind the altar, ranged round
  the apse, were the seats of the clergy, having in the centre the throne
  of the bishop. Thus the apse, like the chancel of an English parish
  church, had a double function; the portion containing the altar was the
  sanctuary, the portion containing the seats of the bishop and his
  presbyters was the choir; basilicas so orientated were divided into nave,
  sanctuary, choir; whereas English parish churches divide into nave,
  choir, sanctuary. Many examples of basilicas with eastern nave and
  western choir still survive in Rome, Dalmatia, and Istria. To this day in
  Milan cathedral and St Mark's, Venice, the stalls of the clergy and
  singers are placed on either side of and at the back of the high altar;
  the apse, with infinite loss to the dignity of the services, being made
  to serve both as sanctuary and choir.</p>

  <p>There is, however, an alternative plan, which may have been in use
  from the first simultaneously with the other. At any rate it can be but
  little later, for in 386 was begun the important church of St Paul
  <i>extra muros</i> at Rome, with apse to the east and nave to the west.
  By this alteration, if no further change had been made, the congregation
  would face eastward, but the celebrant and the bishop with his presbyters
  westward. Strangely enough, this curious arrangement was actually adopted
  at least once in England. In the walling of the semicircle of the
  cathedral apse at Norwich there still remains the bishop's throne and
  portions of the seats of his clergy. And since Norwich cathedral is not
  orientated to the west, but to the east, it follows that the people faced
  east and the bishop and clergy west; it is hardly conceivable, however,
  that the celebrant can have faced west. Such a disposition can never have
  been but rare. A new arrangement was made; in the first place the
  celebrant was made to face eastward, with his back to the congregation,
  thus permanently obscuring their view of the altar and of many portions
  of the office; in spite of its obvious and great disadvantages this
  position has been retained in the vast majority of Western churches ever
  since. There remained the question of the seating of the bishop and
  presbyters. The remedy adopted was to transfer them from the apse to the
  nave; the result being that they sat to the west instead of to the east
  of the altar. In this second position for some considerable time the
  seats of the clergy remained. At S. Clemente, S. Maria in Cosmedin,<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> and other basilican churches
  in Rome, the seats of the clergy still remain in the eastern bays of the
  nave, separated off, however, all round by low marble screens, which, at
  S. Clemente, are mainly those of the sixth century church.</p>

  <p>Great was the revolution wrought in church planning by the
  determination that the laity, clergy, and celebrant should all alike face
  East. To the Catholic believer nothing was of more mystic import than the
  orientation of the church. He prayed toward the East, toward the Holy
  Land where his Lord lived and died and was buried; he looked forward to
  the dawn of that day when He should come from the East to judge the quick
  and dead.</p>

  <p>The next step appears first in ninth century churches, and in the plan
  of the monastery of St Gall. It involved no change in the position of the
  stalls of the clergy; but instead of being placed in the eastern bays of
  the nave, the sanctuary was lengthened to contain them. And so we reach
  the familiar parochial chancel, with its western portion forming a choir,
  and its eastern a sanctuary. The clergy left the nave and the laity in
  the midst of whom they had so long sung and prayed, and removed to the
  chancel, where to the north and south were solid walls, while to the
  west, no doubt very shortly, was added a screen guarding the entrance to
  the chapel. Though the new plan made no alteration in the relative
  position of the stalls of the clergy, it was nevertheless a real
  revolution. The chancel became practically a secluded, closed chapel; the
  offices and services which had been performed in the midst of the laity
  became more and more the prerogative of a privileged ecclesiastical
  order; in the end, in the greater churches, special altars were put up
  for the laity in the nave; except in the parish churches, laymen lost the
  right to participate in services at the High Altar. <!-- Page 21 --><span

  <p>In our great monastic and collegiate churches it was long before the
  ninth century innovation&mdash;viz., the insertion of the choir in the
  eastern limb of the church&mdash;was generally adopted; in some it was
  never adopted at all. The typical Cistercian churches, <i>e.g.</i>,
  Kirkstall, reverted to the Early Christian arrangement, by which the
  eastern division of the church was appropriated exclusively to the
  sanctuary; and this was the case with many Benedictine and collegiate
  churches also. Till ignorant and incompetent "restorers" were let loose
  on them, the eastern limb of the cathedrals of the Secular Canons of
  Wells and Hereford, that of the Benedictine cathedral of Ely and others
  formed one vast sanctuary, the stalls being placed under the central
  tower and in the eastern part of the nave; at Wells the choir had a
  length of 47 feet, but the sanctuary of 67 feet. The reason why a
  sanctuary so long was required was no doubt that it was desired to place
  in it two altars; one, the "choir" or "matins" altar, for ordinary
  services; the other, the High altar, more to the east, reserved for High
  Mass.<a name="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> <!-- Page 22

  <p>In some cases, <i>e.g.</i>, at Westminster, in many Cistercian
  churches, and in Spanish cathedrals, the stalls were not placed under the
  central tower, but still more to the west, wholly in the nave. In Gothic
  days, however, in English plans&mdash;Westminster is French in
  plan&mdash;the tendency was more and more to place the choir of the
  monastic and collegiate churches in the eastern limb, just as in a parish
  church. In the cathedrals the precedent was first set at Canterbury,
  where in 1096 Prior Ernulph set out a new eastern limb consisting of an
  eastern apse preceded by no less than nine bays. Sometimes there was a
  special reason for the removal of the choir from the crossing and the
  nave. In several cases&mdash;in pious recollection of the burial of many
  a martyr in Early Christian days down in the catacombs of Rome&mdash;the
  Italian practice of constructing a crypt beneath the eastern limb was
  followed. This had been so as early as St Wilfrid, 671-678, whose crypts
  at Ripon and Hexham still survive, and in the Anglo-Saxon cathedrals of
  Winchester, Worcester, Rochester, Gloucester, Canterbury, York, and Old
  St Paul's. And when these were remodelled by the Norman conquerors, in
  all cases the crypt was reproduced. Such crypts of course necessitate the
  building of the eastern limb at a higher level than crossing and nave; in
  some cases, <i>e.g.</i>, at Canterbury, the difference in height is very
  considerable. The result must have been that where as at Canterbury the
  sanctuary was a long one, the High altar at its east end must have been
  invisible, or nearly so, to monks seated in the crossing and nave.
  Consequently, first at Canterbury <i>c.</i> 1100, in the thirteenth
  century at Rochester, Old St Paul's and Worcester, and in the fourteenth
  century at Winchester and York, the stalls were removed to the eastern
  limb, the western portion of which now became choir. The only exception
  among cathedrals with crypts is Gloucester, where the crypt is low and
  the eastern limb is short and where the stalls remain to this day beneath
  the central tower. The example set by cathedrals with crypts was soon
  followed by churches of every degree which had none; whether Benedictine,
  such as at Chester, Augustinian, as at Carlisle, or served by Secular
  Canons, as at Exeter. And so in the churches of monks, regular canons and
  secular canons alike, most of the ecclesiastical authorities reverted to
  what had been all along the normal plan of the English parish church,
  viz., an eastern limb containing choir as well as presbytery.<a

<p><!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>{25}</span></p>

  <p>The length of the stalled choir varied of course with the number of
  monks or canons serving the church. In a church of the first rank, such
  as Lincoln or Chester, about sixty stalls seems as a rule to have been
  found sufficient. These would generally occupy three bays; where more
  than three bays are occupied with stalls, it is usually because more
  stalls have been added at some later period, as at Lincoln, Norwich, and
  Henry the Seventh's chapel, Westminster. In the centre, between the
  stalls, a considerable space had to be left free, in order to leave room
  for processions from the High Altar to the lectern and to the
  ecclesiastics in their stalls; as well as for processions of the whole
  ecclesiastical establishment on Palm Sunday, Corpus Christi day, Easter
  Sunday and other festivals, and on every Sunday in the year. The lectern
  also was often of great size, and a gangway had to be left on either side
  of it. In Lincoln Minster the space from one chorister's desk to the
  chorister's desk opposite is 18 feet: from the back of the northern to
  the back of the southern stalls is 40½ feet, which is above the average
  breadth of an English cathedral or monastic choir. The breadth of the
  choir conditioned the whole of the planning of the church; for as a rule
  the nave and transepts were naturally given the same breadth as the
  choir, in order that the central tower should be square.</p>

  <p>As for the number of rows of stalls on either side of the choir, it
  was usually three, rising successively in height; at Lincoln the floor of
  the uppermost row is 2 feet 6 inches above that of the choir; the
  canopies rise 22 feet above the floor. At Lincoln modern additions have
  been made; at present the upper row consists of 62 canopied stalls; 12 of
  them being "return" stalls facing east; 25 facing north and 25 facing
  south. Below them is a row of stalls without canopies; of these lower
  stalls there were originally 46; in front of these again are the seats of
  the "children of the choir."</p>

  <p>The number of stalls in the uppermost row was regulated in a
  collegiate church by the number of prebends founded in the church; in a
  monastic church by the number of monks in the monastery. At Westminster
  the number of monks between 1339 and 1538 varied from 49 to 52, 47, 30;
  in the upper stalls there was accommodation for 64. At Southwell there
  were 16 prebendaries; at times some of these were foreigners, and never
  visited Southwell or England; the rest stayed in their country parishes,
  and it was sometimes with great difficulty that a single prebendary could
  be got together to take charge of the Minster services; they had,
  however, deputies; and for them and their masters the two western bays of
  the present choir were probably appropriated. And for the meetings of
  this collegiate body, which were held seldom, and which hardly ever had
  an attendance of more than a half dozen prebendaries, one of the most
  magnificent Chapter houses in <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page26"></a>{26}</span>England was built. At Wells there were 54
  canons or prebendaries, each with his own separate estate or prebend; the
  greater number of them resided on their prebendal estates in the country;
  only on rare occasions did they come up to Wells, and then probably only
  for the time occupied by some important meeting; even on such occasions
  there seem never to have been more than 20 canons present.<a
  name="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Nevertheless stalls were
  duly provided for the whole 54, and the Psalter was divided into 54
  portions for daily recitation by the Bishop and his canons. Each of these
  absentee canons at Wells had or was expected to have a deputy in the form
  of a "vicar choral" who was paid by him a small stipend called
  "stall-wages." A beautiful street of little houses&mdash;one of the
  loveliest things in that loveliest of English cities&mdash;built for the
  vicars, still survives at Wells; others at Hereford, Lincoln, Chichester
  and elsewhere. At Wells the first and highest row of stalls was in
  practice occupied by the senior canons, the priest-vicars and deacons;
  the second row by junior deacons, subdeacons and others; the third row by
  choristers on the foundation; in front of that was a seat for choristers
  on probation. The seating of the choirs, however, naturally differed with
  the constitution of the collegiate body. Beverley Minster was not a
  cathedral proper; but its church and its establishment were on cathedral
  scale, and there are no less than 68 stalls. At Beverley the exact
  position in the upper row of the provost, treasurer, chancellor, clerk of
  the works, and other dignitaries was definitely settled in 1391 by Thomas
  Arundel, Archbishop of York. He directed that the clerks or vicars should
  occupy the lower stalls, each in front of the canon, his master; and that
  the choristers should sit in front of the clerks. "Clerici vero et omnes
  et singuli in secunda forma qui libet coram magistro suo. Pueri vero seu
  choristae ante clericos predictos loca sua teneant ut fieri consuevit
  etiam ab antiquo."<a name="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> At
  the back of the canons' stalls in many churches, <i>e.g.</i>, Chester and
  Norwich cathedrals (<a href="#page48">48</a>), may still be seen painted
  the name of the country parish where the canon's prebend lay.
  Appointments to such canonries are still regularly made; but it has
  become usual to style the occupants "honorary canons" or "prebendaries."
  As a matter of fact they are just as much canons as the residentiaries.
  The difference is that the latter come into residence for three months a
  year or longer, while the former need not come at all; and if they did
  come, there is no house to receive them nor any stipend. How the
  cathedral and collegiate establishments lost, long before the
  Reformation, the services of the great majority of their staff cannot be
  told here; partly it arose from sheer neglect of duty, partly it was
  imposed on the canons by the necessity of serving in their parish
  churches and of superintending their estates. <!-- Page 27 --><span

  <p>At the backs of canons' stalls is sometimes painted the verse of a
  psalm. This refers to a very ancient usage. The daily recitation of the
  whole Psalter by the members of a cathedral chapter, according to the
  psalms attached to their respective prebends, formed part, in the opinion
  of Mr Henry Bradshaw, of the <i>Consuetudines</i> introduced by the
  Norman bishops in the twelfth century. In the <i>Liber Niger</i> or
  <i>Consuetudinary</i> of Lincoln Minster, copies of which, earlier than
  1383, remain in the Muniment Room, it is stated that "it is an ancient
  usage of the church of Lincoln to say one mass and the whole psalter
  daily on behalf of the living and deceased benefactors of the church." At
  Wells also the whole Psalter was recited daily for the same pious
  purpose. At Lincoln tablets still are to be seen on the backs of the
  stalls giving the initial verse in Latin of the psalms which the holder
  of the prebend is bound to recite daily: and at the installation of each
  prebendary, the Dean calls his attention to the tablet and admonishes him
  not to discontinue the obligation (<a href="#page52">52</a>). Even at St
  Paul's, though the original stalls all perished in the fire of 1666,
  fifteen of the present stalls on each side are inscribed with the Latin
  words with which various psalms commence; the Psalter here being divided
  into thirty portions.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER III</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CANOPIED STALLS</p>

  <p>It is probable that all the back stalls of monastic and collegiate
  churches had originally some form of canopy. For this there was a very
  practical reason, in the desire of the occupants of the stalls to have
  their tonsured heads protected from down draughts, which from open
  triforium chambers imperfectly tiled must often have been excessive. A
  great number of these canopies have been destroyed, usually in the
  seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, to make room for galleries,
  <i>e.g.</i>, at Wells in 1590 and 1690, and Hexham in 1740.<a
  name="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> In Belgium not a single
  set of stalls retains canopies. When the galleries were removed in modern
  restorations, the ancient forms of canopy were frequently not replaced,
  but something of modern design was put up. This should be borne in mind
  in examining the cresting of the stalls as it is at present; much of it
  is not original either in material or design.</p>

  <p>The following is a list approximately in chronological order of some
  of the finest sets of stalls in cathedral, monastic, collegiate and

  <p>The stalls of the churches of Ratzburg illustrated by M. J.
  Gailhabaud, vol. iv., seem to be of the middle of the twelfth century;
  they are of clumsy design and in a fragmentary condition. At Hastières
  and Gendron-Celles, both near Dinant, Belgium, are simple stalls of the
  thirteenth century.<a name="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In France the chief examples are those in Notre Dame de la Roche;
  fragments occur also in Poitiers cathedral and the church of Saulieu.<a
  name="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The earliest stallwork of which we have remains is in Rochester
  cathedral (<a href="#page30">30</a>). From fragments which remained it
  was found that the stalls had been about 3 feet 6 inches high, and had
  hinged seats only 13½ inches from the floor; there was a space of 2 feet
  9 inches between the seat and the form in front, and the seat was 2 feet
  deep.<a name="NtA_15" href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> There was but a
  single row of stalls, and the forms were very low; only 22¼ inches above
  the platform on which they stood. They are too low to have been used as
  book rests; which indeed would have been unnecessary, as the monks knew
  the Psalter and their services by heart; the only service books employed
  being the big books which lay on the great lectern in the gangway of the
  choir. It is probable that the forms were of use at certain parts of the
  service when the monks were <i>prostrati super formas</i>.<a

  <p>At Westminster the original stallwork of the choir has perished;
  fortunately, however, a sketch of a portion of it has been preserved (<a
  href="#page31">31</a>).<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
  That the sketch is trustworthy may be seen by comparing it with the
  description of the stalls by Dart in his <i>Westmonasterium</i> (1742),
  who says that "the stalls were crowned with acute Gothic arches supported
  by pillars." The sketch shews slender shafts with molded capitals,
  neckings and bases, supporting lancet arches which are without cusps; at
  the back are trifoliated lancets. The work belongs to the period when the
  eastern bays of the nave were built, viz., 1258 to 1272. In Henry VII.'s
  chapel are two misericords of conventional foliage; no doubt they
  belonged originally to Henry the Third's choir. A valuable and little
  known example of a thirteenth century stall survives at Hemingborough,
  Yorkshire (<a href="#page87">87</a>). At Peterborough also fragments of
  stalls of the same century remain; but they have backing of Jacobean
  character (<a href="#page32">32</a>). At Gloucester a fragment of a
  thirteenth century stall has been preserved behind the seat of the Canon
  in residence. <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Apart from the above, we seem to have no stallwork of earlier date
  than the fourteenth century. Of that period the earliest and perhaps the
  most beautiful is that in Winchester cathedral. The pulpit was given by
  Prior Silkstede, whose name is inscribed on it; he was prior from 1498 to
  1524; the desks and stools of the upper tier have the date 1540. The
  canopies are of one story. Each is surmounted by a straight sided gable
  or pediment, which is crocketed and finialled and has compound cusping.
  The upper part of each gable is perforated with a multifoiled trefoil.
  Below, the stall is spanned by a broad pointed arch, which is subdivided
  into two pointed and detached arches, with foliated cusps. These two
  minor arches carry circles with varying tracery. At the back of each
  stall (<a href="#page35">35</a>) is a broad arch containing a pair of
  detached pointed trifoliated arches supported by shafts whose capitals
  are alternately molded and foliated. These two small arches carry a
  circle within which is inscribed a cinquefoil, cusped and foliated. The
  spandrils between each pair of containing arches at the back of the
  stalls are occupied by foliage admirably carved, in which are figures of
  men, animals, birds, &amp;c. There is no pronounced ogee arch anywhere,
  though there is a suspicion of one where the open trefoils of the gables
  rest upon the containing arches. The tracery too of all the circles is
  geometrical, <i>i.e.</i>, composed of simple curves; there is no flowing
  or ogee tracery with compound curves. It may be assumed therefore that
  the work is earlier than <i>c.</i> 1315. On the other hand the foliage of
  the spandrils has pronounced bulbous or ogee curves and the pediments
  contain compound cusping; both features being characteristic of ornament
  of the first half of the fourteenth century. <!-- Page 34 --><span

  <p>Taking all into account, 1305 may be taken as an approximate date for
  this superb work. It is usually assigned to the year 1296, on the ground
  of similarity of design to that of the Westminster tomb of Edmund
  Crouchback who died in that year; but that is to forget that he died in
  debt, leaving instructions that he was not to be buried till his debts
  were paid: it is likely therefore that his tomb is several years later
  than 1296; indeed, except that its main arch has not ogee arches in its
  cusping, it is not much earlier in design than the adjoining tomb of
  Aymer de Valence, who died in 1324. Comparison may be made also with the
  monument in Winchelsea church of Gervase Alard, who was still alive in
  1306; and with the monuments in Ely cathedral of Bishop Louth (<i>ob.</i>
  1298) and in Canterbury cathedral of Archbishop Peckham (<i>ob.</i>
  1292).</p>

  </div>

  <p>On the other hand in Chichester cathedral (<a href="#page36">36</a>),
  the ogee motive is supreme. There are no more pointed arches; every arch
  is an ogee; and the cresting consists of wavy tracery surmounted by a
  battlement. The cusping of the upper ogee arches is compound; the foliage
  of pronounced bulbous character. It is unlikely that this work can be
  much earlier than that of the Ely stalls, which were not begun till 1338.
  On the evidence of costume and armour it would seem that the misericords
  were in course of execution between <i>c.</i> 1320 and <i>c.</i> 1340;
  the stallwork would probably be the last part of the work; and <!-- Page
  37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>{37}</span>as the
  Chichester Records are reported to assign the work to Bishop John
  Langton, who died in 1337, we may assign 1335 as an approximate date to
  the stalls.</p>

  <p>When we come to Ely, we deal with ascertained dates; it is known that
  the stalls were commenced in 1338. They are on <!-- Page 38 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>{38}</span>a noble scale, but have
  been "improved" by restorers, who among things have actually inserted
  Belgian carvings in the upper niches. These stalls have two distinct
  tiers of canopies, so that they rise to a considerable height. Each of
  the lower canopies has a pointed arch with compound ogee cusping; above
  each of these is a niche with three gabled canopies carrying a low
  spirelet which is flanked by ornate pinnacles; the whole forming a very
  beautiful composition. It is a great advance from the one-story design of
  Chichester (<a href="#page36">36</a>), to the two stories of Ely.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The great east window of Gloucester choir was glazed <i>c.</i> 1350;
  by which date half of the stalls were ready. The northern stalls are the
  work of Abbot Staunton (1337-1351); the southern of Abbot Horton
  (1351-1377); they replace thirteenth century stalls erected by Elias de
  Lideford. The design of the stalls is curious and interesting. In the
  canopy the leading motif is the "bowing ogee," repeated twice; it is well
  seen in the contemporary work of the Percy monument at Beverley and the
  arcading of Ely Lady Chapel. The upper and acutely pointed ogee is
  finialled, and is flanked by battlemented and crocketed pinnacles; behind
  is a battlemented, crocketed and finialled spirelet. Behind the spirelets
  is arcading composed of window tracery; and above the arcading is a
  crested horizontal cornice. At first sight the design looks no more
  advanced than that of Ely; but if the tracery of the arcading be
  examined, it will be found that the three lower lights have
  supermullions, and that the centre-pieces are straight-sided. In
  woodwork, as in stone, it was at Gloucester that the reign of the
  straight line commenced (<a href="#page38">38</a>). <!-- Page 39 --><span

  <p>Then comes a group of stalls which it is not easy to date, but all of
  which are redolent of fourteenth century inspiration; those of Lancaster
  church, those of the cathedral and All Saints' church at Hereford, and
  those of Abergavenny priory and Norwich cathedral. The Lancaster stalls
  are the <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of English woodwork, wonderful alike in
  design and execution; in woodwork they must have been in their day
  unrivalled; in stone they find a compeer in the marvellous detail of the
  Percy monument and in the still finer work at the back of the reredos in
  Beverley Minster. They do not shew the slightest sign of the revolution
  of design which had commenced in Gloucester transept <i>c.</i> 1330, and
  which by the end of the century was to overspread all England; they are
  the natural development of the design of the first half of the fourteenth
  century carried forward to an extent for which the only parallel is to be
  found in the highly developed Flamboyant detail of French, Spanish, and
  Flemish design of the middle and latter part of the fifteenth century. So
  inordinately Flamboyant are the traceries (<a href="#page41">41</a>, <a
  href="#page42">42</a>) that one would unhesitatingly ascribe them to
  Continental artists did one not see the touch of the English craftsman
  everywhere; compare for instance the tracery shewn at the top of page <a
  href="#page42">42</a> with that of the west window of the far-away church
  of Snettisham, Norfolk.<a name="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>
  One hesitates to assign to the Lancaster work such an early date; but if
  the Percy monument was in course of erection, as we know it was, soon
  after 1340, it is quite possible that the Lancaster stalls also date
  before the arrival of the Black Death in 1349-50. After that date a great
  change came over design; the rich exuberance of Ely Lady Chapel, the
  Easter sepulchres, sedilia and piscinas of mid-Lincolnshire and the Percy
  monument at Beverley, appear no more. Any lingering hesitation one may
  have, however, is removed by a scrutiny of the moldings, especially those
  of the capitals, neckings and bases;<a name="NtA_19"

  <p>The Lancaster stalls may be regarded as the Flamboyant version of the
  stallwork of Winchester cathedral, with which they should be compared (<a
  href="#page34">34</a>). Like the Winchester stalls, they are but one
  story high; they do not aspire to the two stories of Ely and Norwich.
  There is a tradition, unsubstantiated, that these stalls came from
  Cockersand abbey in 1543. But St Mary's, Lancaster, was a priory church
  attached, first, to the abbey of St Martin, Sées, in Normandy, and then,
  when alien priories were suppressed, transferred to Sion abbey,
  Middlesex. In 1367 Lancaster priory had a revenue of £80, say £1,200 per
  annum, and was quite able to provide stalls for itself.</p>

  <p>The lower part of each canopy consists of an ogee arch; this is
  somewhat low, but in compensation is surmounted by an exceptionally lofty
  pediment. Both ogee arch and straight-sided pediment are filled with
  perforated tracery. All this tracery, both above and below, differs from
  bay to bay; the craftsman would not and could not repeat them; he was
  simply overflowing with inventive design. The tracery of the ogee arch
  rests on an arch, usually an ogee arch, which is cusped in ogee,
  semicircular or segmental curves, tipped with charmingly diversified
  pendants of faces, fruits and foliage; the interval between <!-- Page 44
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>{44}</span>the two arches
  is filled with a network of compound curves&mdash;a labyrinth of
  beautiful forms&mdash;enticing the eye to attempt to follow their
  ramifications by ever new routes; each little pattern is cusped, and each
  has the ogee curve at one end or both ends, or at one side (<a
  href="#page41">41</a>). Equally ingenious and diversified is the tracery
  which fills up the tall pediment. The broad band of foliated ornament,
  which forms a kind of continuous crocketing, in spite of much mutilation
  remains the richest example in English woodwork.<a name="NtA_20"
  href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Notice too the little masks which
  immortalise the features of the Lancaster men of 1340; sometimes no doubt
  they represent the carvers themselves.</p>

  <p>In Hereford cathedral the stalls are of one story and have a
  horizontal cresting. At the back of each stall is an ogee arch, and in
  front a bowing ogee arch; there is some lack of contrast. The sides of
  the upper ogees are prettily flanked by graduated window tracery; and the
  great multiplication and predominance of the vertical line makes it
  likely that the stalls were put up rather after than before the Black
  Death (<a href="#page43">43</a>). <!-- Page 46 --><span

  <p>At All Saints', Hereford, is a range of stalls of remarkable beauty.
  They have the bowing ogees, the compound cusping, the intersecting wavy
  tracery of the first half of the fourteenth century; yet the cusping and
  tracery are not in the early manner. In the cathedral the bowing ogees
  meet at an angle of nearly 45°; at All Saints', they project but
  slightly, meeting with a very obtuse point. All Saints' has ogee canopies
  under a coved horizontal tester with supporting shafts, as in the
  cathedral. In the latter the cornice of the tester on the south side has
  a perforated battlemented parapet; that on the north (<a
  href="#page43">43</a>) has brattishing; at All Saints' both sides have
  brattishing, but the pattern is not the same. Hereford suffered much from
  the Black Death of 1350, and it is not likely that a parish church would
  be able to afford such costly stalls before the last quarter of that
  century. We may suggest 1380 as a probable date. It must be remembered
  that nearly all changes in mediæval design originated with the stone
  mason; it was some time before they were caught up by the craftsmen in
  other materials (<a href="#page44">44</a>).</p>

  <p>To the exquisite stallwork of Abergavenny the remarks made on that at
  All Saints', Hereford, again apply; it is redolent of the inspiration of
  the first half of the fourteenth century; but its effects are gained in a
  totally different way: this also may be assigned to the last quarter of
  the fourteenth century;<a name="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
  say <i>c.</i> 1380 or later (<a href="#page46">46</a>).</p>

  <p>The stalls at Wingfield, Suffolk, might date from 1362, when the
  church was made collegiate; but much work was done in the time of Michael
  de la Pole, 2nd Duke of Suffolk, and his wife, Catherine Stafford; he
  died in 1415; the badges of Wingfield and Stafford&mdash;a wing and the
  Stafford knot&mdash;are seen on the arches between the de la Pole chapel
  and the chancel. The design of the stalls and desks is such as might be
  expected early in the fifteenth century, especially in East Anglia, where
  fourteenth century design lingered long (<a href="#page46">46</a>). <!--

  <p>At first sight the Norwich stalls might seem to belong to the first
  half of the fourteenth century; as in the stalls of Chichester, the lower
  canopies have ogee arches; while there is a second story above, as at
  Ely. The exuberance of earlier design is present in the cusping and the
  crockets; notice how the crockets vary from bay to bay, one set being
  actually composed of hawks. Nevertheless supermullions rise from the apex
  of each minor arch of the window tracery of the spandrils, and are
  conclusive evidence that the date is considerably later. The stalls and
  misericords below are of two periods. In the earlier set of twenty-four
  the seats are polygonal; the armour depicted is that of the last half of
  the fourteenth century, and there are arms of donors who died
  respectively in 1380, 1400 and 1428; so that we may assign the
  approximate date of 1390 to this set of misericords. The remaining
  thirty-eight misericords have seats curved on plan, and, according to Mr
  Harrod, are not later than the middle of the fifteenth century. Now the
  canopies extend above both sets of misericords; the probability therefore
  is that they were put up together with the second set of misericords. But
  there is one curious bit of evidence in the canopy work itself, which is
  here illustrated (<a href="#page48">48</a>); viz, that one set of
  crockets consists of hawks with jesses. Now on the arms of John Wakering,
  who was bishop from 1416 to 1425 are three hawks' lures;<a name="NtA_22"
  href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> that being so, the probability is that
  the whole of the canopies, and the second set of misericords as well, are
  <!-- Page 49 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"></a>{49}</span>of
  the approximate date of 1420. Though so much later than the Ely stalls,
  the absence of the spirelet and the retention of the horizontal cornice
  marks this, in spite of much beauty of detail, as a retrogressive
  design.</p>

  <p>The stalls of Sherborne abbey, Dorset, are somewhat of a puzzle (<a
  href="#page49">49</a>). The arch design, with the compound cusping, is in
  accordance with that of the lower story of the Ely stalls of 1338, except
  that the arches are semicircular or nearly so; but fourteenth century
  exuberance and versatility have faded away; the design is regular,
  symmetrical, prim. There was a great fire in Sherborne Minster in 1436;
  the piers of the choir are still reddened with the flames; the former
  stalls would certainly be consumed, and these no doubt are their
  successors.</p>

  <p>The stalls at Hereford St Peter and Stowlangtoft are illustrated to
  shew that not only monastic and cathedral churches, but parish churches
  also possessed abundance of fine stallwork. Stowlangtoft is a remote
  Suffolk village; but possesses a magnificent set of the original carved
  benches in the nave and stalls in the chancel (<a href="#page91">91</a>).
  The woodwork is probably of the <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page50"></a>{50}</span>date of the church, which seems to have been
  rebuilt late in the fourteenth or early in the following century; the
  Hereford church is a town church; its stalls appear to be well on in the
  fifteenth century (<a href="#page89">89</a>).</p>

  <p>In Bristol cathedral the stalls consist of a range of traceried panels
  surmounted by a horizontal coved cornice. There are now twenty-eight
  stalls. They bear the arms and initials of Abbot Elyot (1515-1526).</p>

  <p>At St David's a totally new departure occurs in stall design; the
  motif now being clearly taken from an oak screen surmounted by a
  parapetted loft (<a href="#page109">109</a>). In the fourteenth century
  stalls illustrated the ogee arch was the characteristic feature; in the
  fifteenth century the fashion was to take an elongated ogee arch, and
  truncate it, employing only the upper portion with the concave curve;
  these semi-ogees occur everywhere both in stone and wood; they are well
  seen at St David's in the backing of the stalls. This work has superseded
  that which was ordered to be put up in 1342 by Bishop Gower, only one
  fragment of which remains; it was found above the present canopy and
  consisted of a finialled ogee canopy, agreeing nearly in detail and
  character with those portions of the Bishop's throne which are of Gower's
  time.<a name="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> The present
  stalls, misericords, stall backs and canopy are all fifteenth century
  work; on the dean's stall (in this cathedral, as nowadays at Southwell,
  the bishop was also dean) are the arms of Bishop Tully (1460-1481), and
  on the Treasurer's stall is the name of <span class="sm">POLE</span>, who
  was treasurer in the bishop's latter days. The parapets above cannot have
  been added till the sixteenth century; for they terminate to the east in
  scrolls of the form common in cinquecento work.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER IV</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">TABERNACLED STALLS</p>

  <p>In the latter years of the fourteenth century we come to a new form of
  stall design; one in which the English carvers won their greatest
  triumphs, and which became the standard and typical design for English
  stalls. It is seen in the magnificent tabernacled stalls of Lincoln,
  Chester, Nantwich, Carlisle, Windsor, St Asaph, Ripon, Manchester,
  Westminster, Beverley and Durham. To distinguish this group, we may term
  it "stallwork with tabernacled canopies," or, more shortly, "tabernacled
  stalls." Though new, it is, like all design, based on earlier models. At
  Ely (<a href="#page37">37</a>) two distinct and conflicting designs are
  combined; to those two the Lincoln carvers gave unity (<a
  href="#page17">17</a>). The stallwork at Ely is in two stories; but they
  are not correlated in any way. The upper story consists of canopied
  niches, now containing figures, formerly probably occupied by paintings.
  At Lincoln the lower story was omitted, reducing the elevation to a
  single story; while the niches of the Ely upper story were brought low
  down, and made to enshrine the vested canons below. The Lincoln niches,
  however, are of more elaboration than those of Ely; in the latter each
  niche was fronted by three straight-sided pediments; in the former the
  pediments are hollow-sided, and in front of each is a bowing ogee arch.
  Then these niches are repeated above, except that each niche is single
  instead of being triple, and enshrines a statuette of wood, and is
  flanked by window tracery. Moreover, above each upper niche, as at Ely,
  rises a lofty spirelet with crockets and finials, encircled by a coronal
  of ogee gables and flanked by tall slender pinnacles, themselves also
  ornamented with miniature niches, crockets and finials. Also the upper
  portions of the shafts below are niched, crocketed and battlemented. Thus
  the Ely design becomes thoroughly harmonious and at one with itself.</p>

  <p>As a rule, design did not originate with the wood carver; it first
  found expression in stone. And it well may be that to earlier work
  executed in stone rather than to the stallwork of Ely the Lincoln design
  is to be attributed. At any rate, the tabernacled canopies of wood are
  anticipated in most marked fashion in the monument of Archbishop
  Stratford in Canterbury cathedral. He died in 1348; his monument is
  therefore earlier than any of the tabernacled canopies in wood. It
  consists of two stories, with three gables below and a single niche
  above; then come spirelets with pinnacles between.<a name="NtA_24"
  href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> There is a similar monument to
  Archbishop Kemp, who died in 1454. Of the Lincoln work Mr A. W. Pugin
  said that "the stalls are executed in the most perfect manner, not only
  as regards variety and beauty of ornamental design, but in accuracy of
  workmanship, which is frequently deficient in ancient examples of
  woodwork.... They are certainly superior to any other choir fittings of
  that period remaining in England. The misericords also are all varied in
  design, and consist of foliage, animals, figures and even historical
  subjects, beautifully designed, and executed with surpassing skill and
  freedom." As the work was begun by the treasurer, John of Welbourn, who
  died in 1380, we may give it the approximate date of 1370. This is borne
  out by the fact <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page54"></a>{54}</span>that on the base of the Dean's stall are the
  bearings of Dean Stretchley, who died in 1376.<a name="NtA_25"

  <p>Judging from the armour represented on the misericords the design of
  the Lincoln stalls was copied very soon afterwards, say <i>c.</i> 1390,
  in Chester cathedral, but with a magnificence of foliated ornament which
  is reminiscent of the glorious stalls of Lancaster. For the main lines of
  the design, however, the new type of canopy which had been worked out at
  Lincoln was taken as a model; the details only are those of Lancaster,
  the general design is from Lincoln. As at Lincoln, the lower canopy has
  duplicated gables in front of each of the three faces of the main
  structure of the canopy. This main structure starts from between
  pinnacled buttresses, as it were, separating each canopy; then is brought
  forward like an oriel window, having square-headed traceried windows, the
  whole surmounted by a battlemented pierced parapet. In front of each face
  of the oriel is first a truncated ogee arch, and second, a complete ogee
  arch, both springing from a battlemented and pinnacled corner buttress.
  These buttresses, whether between the canopies or in front of the corners
  of the oriels, are truncated, the former rising not from the shoulders of
  the stalls below but from angels, the latter from carved bosses or
  paterae. The gables at the back spring from a higher level than those in
  front, and, as at Lincoln, are truncated ogee arches. The three front
  gables are complete ogee arches, which differ from those in the Lincoln
  stallwork in that their lower convex curve spreads outward again. This is
  an important matter; for though this compound ogee arch is not employed
  in the Lincoln stalls, yet it occurs up and down the cathedral in the
  stonework of the fourteenth century; <i>e.g.</i>, in the arcading under
  the western towers<a name="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> put
  up by the same treasurer who paid for the stalls. It is so special and
  characteristic to Lincoln that its presence at Chester may be taken as a
  decisive proof of Lincoln influence in the design of the stalls. In the
  upper story is a central niche, flanked by window tracery, as at Lincoln.
  Above rises a lofty spirelet, encircled at its base by "Lincoln ogee"
  gables. Between the spirelets, as at Ely and Lincoln, are tall pinnacles.
  The leafage of the lower canopies should be compared with that of
  Lancaster. In the five examples illustrated (<a href="#page53">53</a>, <a
  href="#page55">55</a>, <a href="#page56">56</a>) it will be seen how
  consummate and versatile in design were these mediæval craftsmen; they
  were bubbling over with design, and could not repeat themselves if they
  wished.<a name="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> <!-- Page 55

  <p>The magnificent church of Nantwich, Cheshire, was in building before
  the Black Death of 1349; the work was then stopped; and when it was
  resumed, it was carried out in a different style. To this later period
  belong the south transept and the east window of the chancel with
  rectilinear tracery; it is probable that the pulpit and stalls also
  belong to this second work, <i>c.</i> 1400. The design connects itself
  with that of the Lincoln and Chester stalls in the absence of any line of
  demarcation between the upper and lower portions; but while that of
  Chester is reminiscent of early fourteenth century work, that of Nantwich
  is well advanced toward normal fifteenth century design. It is also much
  richer than either, the lower stage being a mass of niches and pinnacles,
  with angel corbels below. The great novelty at Nantwich is the absence of
  spirelets, the absence of which is nobly compensated for by the increased
  height and prominence given to the central of the three upper niches (<a
  href="#page57">57</a>).</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">York Minster</p>
  </div>

  <p>The stalls of York Minster were destroyed by fire in 1819. Both in the
  treatment of the supporting shafts and in the design of the single upper
  niches flanked by window tracery they closely resembled the Lincoln
  stalls, on which they were probably modelled; above the upper niches rose
  spirelets flanked by pinnacles. There is a marked horizontal line midway,
  dividing the composition into two stories (<a href="#page58">58</a>). The
  presbytery of York Minster was built between 1361 and 1370; the choir
  between 1380 and 1400; we may therefore take 1390 as the approximate date
  of the stalls. They are a little later than the Lincoln stalls, and
  probably contemporaneous with those of Chester. A general view of the
  stalls appears in Drake's <i>Eboracum</i>, page 522 (<a
  href="#page18">18</a>).</p>

  <p>At Carlisle the stalls were erected by Bishop Strickland (1399-1413);
  Prior Haithwaite is said to have added the tabernacle work after the year
  1433:<a name="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> it would
  therefore be about forty years later than that at Chester (<a
  href="#page21">21</a>). The lower canopy, as before, has triple gables,
  which are truncated ogees, but the additional front gable of Lincoln and
  Chester is omitted, while the pinnacled buttresses separating the
  canopies are carried by shafts standing on the shoulders of the stalls.
  The line of demarcation between the two stories, which the Lincoln and
  Nantwich designs had minimised, is now emphasised by making the band of
  quatrefoils continuous. The upper story, which in the earlier designs had
  had insufficient dominance, is now heightened and enlarged; it consists
  of three pedestalled niches instead of one; and the flanking window
  tracery of Lincoln and Chester, with its makeshift look, is reduced in
  importance, forming merely the backing of the three upper niches. The
  spirelet above is also greatly enriched, and additional pinnacles are
  introduced. A little prim the design may be in comparison with the
  exuberance of Lincoln, Chester and Nantwich, but the proportions are
  fine, and were the statuettes once more in their niches, it would be a
  very satisfactory composition. Such work as this has well been resembled
  to "a whole wood, or say a thicket of old hawthorn with its topmost
  branches spared, slowly growing into stalls." <!-- Page 60 --><span

  <p>At St Asaph's cathedral the stalls and part of the canopies are
  ancient.<a name="NtA_29" href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The cathedral
  was gutted by fire in 1402, and the stalls were not re-erected till
  1471-1495.</p>

  <p>Fifty years later than the Carlisle stalls were put up those of Ripon
  Minster (<a href="#page60">60</a>). As two of the misericords are
  inscribed 1489 and 1494, they cannot be earlier than the latter year.
  Just as the Chester stalls were a criticism of those of Lincoln, and the
  Lincoln stalls of those of Ely, so the stalls of Ripon are a criticism of
  those of Nantwich and Carlisle. In the latter the upper story had been
  emphasised; at Ripon the bottom story is given the dominance; compared
  with the simplicity of the Carlisle design, the lower stage at Ripon, as
  at Nantwich, is surpassingly rich; gables and pinnacles and window
  tracery are loaded with beautiful detail, cusped arches are added below;
  finally figure sculpture is called in, and capitals and corbels are beset
  with tiny angels. In the string-course between the two stories
  quatrefoils are abandoned; it is molded, foliated and battlemented. In
  the upper story reappears the forest of pinnacles of Carlisle and the
  window tracery of Lincoln. Here, as elsewhere, the design suffers
  grievously from the loss of the statuettes which once ranged continuously
  in the upper story. <!-- Page 62 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Some twenty years later, stallwork was put up in the collegiate church
  of Manchester. On the north side of the choir is a curious shield with
  the initials of Richard Beck, a Manchester merchant, by whom all the
  stalls on that side were erected: the southern stalls were erected by
  Bishop Stanley, and at the west end of them is the shield of Stanley with
  the Stanley legend of the eagle and child. At Manchester craftsman
  ambition had to surpass Ripon and Nantwich. But the lower stages of
  Nantwich and Ripon were unsurpassable; so they were copied, angelettes
  included. The string-course is strengthened and improved by additional
  battlements; but undue emphasis is prevented by making it discontinuous.
  In the upper story, by way of change, there is a reversion to the single
  niche, flanked by window tracery, of Lincoln and Chester; finally,
  originality is asserted by surmounting the whole, in somewhat doubtful
  propriety, with a continuous tester, so that the canopies that cover the
  stalls are themselves covered and protected. This tester has a horizontal
  cornice with brattishing above and cornice braces between pendant pieces
  below. To make room for this the spirelets so much in vogue are replaced,
  as at Nantwich, by canopies with horizontal cresting&mdash;taking it
  altogether, a magnificent design, if only the Ripon stalls had not
  existed (<a href="#page62">62</a>).</p>

  <p>Then come the stalls of Beverley Minster, misericords of which are
  inscribed with the dates 1520 and 1524; the stalls are therefore about a
  dozen years later than those of Manchester. They are modelled closely on
  those of Manchester and Ripon. It is quite conceivable that some of the
  carvers may have worked successively at Ripon (1500), Manchester (1508)
  and Beverley (1520). As at Ripon, the lower story is made predominant,
  the little angels being replaced, however, by human busts&mdash;no great
  improvement; not that they are not full of life and interest (27, 63).
  The string-course is that of Manchester. The upper story has single
  niches flanked by window tracery, as at Manchester. The horizontal canopy
  of Manchester now remains over the return stalls only. On the whole it
  must be admitted that these stalls mark no advance. A bit of original
  design indeed appears at one point, where low, heavy straight-lined
  gables are introduced quite out of harmony with the curving ogee arches
  (<a href="#page64">64</a>).</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Durham</p>
  </div>

  <p>Then comes the Dissolution; a long list of Tudor monarchs reign and
  pass away; Stuarts take their place; Civil War follows; at length at the
  Restoration of 1660 the Church comes to her own again, and John Cosin
  ascends the episcopal throne of Durham. True to the Church of England and
  loyal to Gothic Architecture, he reverts to the consecrated form, and
  tabernacled stalls are reared once more&mdash;one of his many
  contributions to the cathedral and diocese of Durham (<a
  href="#page22">22</a>). Nor is the design an unworthy one; nay, rather it
  is a distinct improvement on that of Carlisle, Ripon, Manchester and
  Beverley; for by abolishing the string-course, he reduces the design to
  the unity with which it started at Lincoln. Moreover, tall pinnacles had
  flanked the spirelets of Ely, Lincoln, Chester, Carlisle, Ripon and
  Beverley, so that really one could not see the wood for the trees; these
  pinnacles are now omitted, and the spirelets get their full value.
  Altogether a very fine design; and the little bits of Renaissance detail
  which here and there creep in, as in the bishop's <!-- Page 67 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>{67}</span>magnificent font cover,<a
  name="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> only add to its charm (<a
  href="#page66">66</a>). Other examples of John Cosin's time are to be
  seen at Brancepeth where he was formerly rector from 1626 to 1633; the
  stalls, screens and pulpit of that church are simply delightful (<a
  href="#page93">93</a>). More of this work is to be seen in the chapel of
  the Bishop's palace at Bishop's Auckland; in the church of his son-in-law
  at Sedgefield and at Sherburn hospital. So Gothic in spirit is this work
  that it has been again and again ascribed to Elizabethan times,
  <i>e.g.</i>, by Billings in his <i>County of Durham</i>. In spite of the
  coarseness of some of the detail and that here and there a bit of
  Classical detail creeps in, it is most interesting and enjoyable; would
  that we had more of these delightful admixtures of Classic and Gothic
  forms; plentiful in Spain and France, they are rare with us.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Dunblane</p>
  </div>

  <p>The stalls in Dunblane cathedral are thought by Messrs Macgibbon and
  Ross<a name="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> to have been put
  up in the time of Bishop James Chisholm (1486-1534). In that case they
  would be <i>c.</i> 1520. "The work is rather rough in execution, not to
  be <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page68"></a>{68}</span>compared with the more characteristic
  woodwork of King's College, Aberdeen"; nevertheless it is very
  picturesque and interesting. The introduction of the centaurs indicates
  Renaissance influence; the foliage carving is a rather curious mixture of
  late Gothic and Classic forms, such as we find elsewhere in Scottish
  carved work of this period. The Scottish thistle is one of the chief
  motifs (<a href="#page67">67</a>).</p>

  <p>In the chapel of King's College, Aberdeen, is a considerable amount of
  fine oak carved work, by far the most extensive and best of its kind in
  Scotland. The chapel itself, in some of its features, bears the character
  of the parish church at Stirling and other Scottish works of the
  beginning of the sixteenth century. The carved stalls, monuments, and
  decorative work of the interior are of the same period, but may possibly
  have been brought from a distance, or executed by foreign workmen engaged
  (like the English plumber) by the bishop. The panels are all of different
  design, and shew a great deal of variety combined with a sufficiently
  uniform effect when the work is viewed as a whole. In some of them the
  details are based on floral forms&mdash;thistle, vine, oak,
  &amp;c.&mdash;while the conventional French fleur-de-lis is also
  introduced.<a name="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

  <p>At this point arises the question how far our stallwork was influenced
  by foreign design. It may be stated at once with confidence that of the
  great majority of the stalls the design is as thoroughly English as the
  oak of which they are built. We have seen that the flowing and ogee forms
  of the Ely tracery were designed not later than 1338, which is at least
  sixty years earlier than any work of the sort in France. We were able to
  see how by gradual modifications of the Ely design the craftsmen were
  able to advance slowly but assuredly to the stallwork of Lincoln,
  Chester, Nantwich, Carlisle, Ripon, Manchester, Beverley, Durham; the
  glorious chain of artistic success is complete; every link is there. But
  there are facts on the other side which, at any rate at Melrose, are
  beyond dispute or controversy. In 1846 a document was communicated to the
  Society of Antiquaries, London, from West Flanders, relating to a dispute
  at Bruges between William Carebis, a Scotch merchant, and John Crawfort,
  a monk of Melrose, on the one hand, and Cornelius de Aeltre, citizen and
  master of the art of carpentry of Bruges, on the other hand. The latter
  had contracted to supply certain stalls and to erect them in the abbey
  church of Melrose, after the fashion of the stalls of the choir of the
  abbey church of Dunis in Flanders, with carving similar to that existing
  in the church of Thosan near Bruges. The stipulated price had been paid,
  and the master carpenter was called to account for delaying to complete
  the work; whereupon he pleaded various excuses, stating that the work had
  been impeded by popular commotions at Bruges, during which he had been
  deserted by his workmen and had suffered heavy losses. It was decided
  that Melrose abbey should bear the cost of its transport to the town of
  Sluys and embarkation there for Scotland, and should make some allowance
  to Cornelius towards his journey to Melrose; and that they should give
  him and his chief carver (<i>formiscissori</i>) a safe-conduct for their
  journey and return. This document was dated 7th October, 1441.<a
  name="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> <!-- Page 69 --><span

  <p>No such wholesale example of foreign design occurs in England;
  nevertheless there are two important instances in which Flemish design is
  to be suspected; viz., in the Royal chapels at Windsor and Westminster.
  As regards the stalls in St George's chapel, Windsor, it is known that
  the tabernacled canopies were begun in 1477 and were completed in 1483;
  thus they took six years to make (<a href="#page69">69</a>).<a
  name="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> The canopies are known to
  have been made in London; the carvers being Robert Ellis and John Filles,
  apparently Englishmen. On the other hand the great Rood, with the statues
  of St George and St Edward and others, was made by Diricke Vangrove and
  Giles Vancastell, who are just as evidently Dutchmen; for four images the
  two Dutchmen were paid at the rate of 5s. per foot; for six canopies the
  two Englishmen received £40, say £480; <i>i.e.</i>, about £80 of our
  money for each canopy. Now here we have Dutch and English carvers engaged
  together on what was practically one work: moreover the more artistic and
  difficult part of the work, the figure sculpture, is entrusted to the
  Dutchmen. It is to the latter probably that the general lines of the
  design are due. The detail is sufficiently English; not so the general
  design. For the Windsor stallwork is intermediate between that of Chester
  (<i>c.</i> 1390) and Carlisle (1433) on the one hand, and Ripon
  (<i>c.</i> 1490) and Manchester (1508) on the other. But it is not a
  development arising out of either of the earlier designs, nor was the
  stallwork of Ripon and Manchester in any way a development from that of
  Windsor. <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page71"></a>{71}</span></p>

<p><!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>{72}</span></p>

  <p>All the larger stallwork of the fifteenth century was, as we have
  seen, designed in two stories, rising into spirelets and pinnacles; at
  Windsor the double story, the spirelet and the pinnacle are all alike
  lacking. It is true that the original canopies were designed quite as
  much for the Knights of the Garter as for the Windsor Canons, and in the
  case of the former the design had to be accommodated to provide supports
  for the knights' helmets, mantles and swords; nevertheless this might
  have been accomplished without utterly breaking away from current design.
  The Windsor design, so far as English work goes, has no ancestry; its
  origin no doubt is to be found in the Netherlands. The Windsor stalls
  have been much tampered with. As Hollar's engraving in Ashmole's
  <i>Institution of the Order of the Garter</i> (1672) shews, over the
  westernmost bay on either side of the choir the canopies contained
  imagery and had a horizontal cresting; and all the other canopies
  consisted alternately of towers and spirelets; the knights being seated
  under the towers and the canons under the spirelets; but since the
  enlargement of the Order in 1786 all the spirelets have been converted
  into towers (<a href="#page71">71</a>). All these towers are surmounted
  by wooden busts, of which the earliest go back to the time of Edward IV.;
  on the bust were placed the knight's helmet, crest and mantlings, which
  hid the busts from view; lower down, in front, hung his sword; banners
  were not added till a later period. At first the real sword and helm were
  put up; later, they were theatrical properties.</p>

  <p>In Winchester cathedral is stallwork of rare beauty in the Lady
  Chapel, which was built in the time of Bishop Courtenay, 1486-1492. In
  some of its details it resembles the Windsor stalls, which were completed
  in 1483; it is therefore feasible that some of the Windsor carvers went
  on to Winchester (<a href="#page73">73</a>). South of the Lady Chapel is
  the chantry chapel of Bishop Langton, 1493-1500, where also the screen
  and coved panelling are of great excellence (<a href="#page72">72</a>);
  there are no stalls. <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>Henry the Seventh's chapel at Westminster was built partly as a Lady
  Chapel, partly to be the mausoleum of Henry VII. and his Queen, and of
  Henry VI.<a name="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> Here the
  canopies with tower-like form and single story and with the absence of
  pinnacle are plainly reminiscent of those of Windsor, and as plainly
  distinct from current English design, as seen at Manchester in 1508 and
  Beverley Minster in 1520; the Westminster and Manchester canopies were
  being made together; but those of Westminster have no connection with the
  grand Northern series of consecutive designs (<a
  href="#page131">131</a>). Besides Windsor influence there may be direct
  influence from the Netherlands; for some of the misericords are evidently
  from the design of a painter or engraver, the subjects being too crowded
  to be properly carved in wood in so limited a space. Mr J. Langton
  Barnard says,<a name="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> "While
  looking over some engravings on copper of Albert Durer, I came across one
  which strikingly resembled the third misericord in the upper row on the
  north side; the resemblance was extremely close, especially in the
  arrangement and folds of the woman's dress; this is stated by Bartsch in
  his <i>Catalogue</i> (vii. 103 and 93) to be one of his earliest plates.
  Another plate of Albert Durer closely resembles the corresponding
  misericord in the lower row on the south side, as regards the position of
  the limbs and the folds of the drapery; while the seventh misericord of
  the lower row on the south side almost exactly resembles a plate by
  Israel van Meckenern, of two monkeys and three young ones." These stalls
  formerly occupied only the three western bays of the chapel; another bay
  was filled with stalls when the Order of the Bath was revived by King
  George the First; the canopy-fronts for an additional bay on each side
  being got by sawing off canopy-backs and putting them up as fronts. The
  tabernacle work is of the richest and most diversified character, varying
  in every canopy (<a href="#page73">73</a>).</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER V</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">RENAISSANCE STALLWORK</p>

  <p>Thus far the stallwork has been wholly of Gothic design, or nearly so.
  We now come to the great change of style, the reversion to the Classic
  art of ancient Rome, which goes by the name of the Renaissance. Of this
  the chief representatives left to us are the stalls of Christchurch,
  Hants; King's College, Cambridge; and Cartmel, Lancashire. The stalls and
  misericords of Christchurch, as we see them now, are a patchwork of
  portions of work of several periods framed together at some more or less
  recent epoch; there are at least two styles of Renaissance work, and
  three or more of Gothic. The earlier Renaissance work, which is seen in
  most of the misericords and on the stall backs is that of William Eyre
  who was Prior from 1502 to 1520 (<a href="#page2">2</a>). There are
  fifty-eight stalls; of the misericords twenty-six have been stolen or
  destroyed. The early date of this work makes it of exceptional importance
  in the history of the introduction of Renaissance art into England. One
  special feature of the work is the portrait panels. These also occur in a
  cupboard preserved in Louth church, Lincolnshire, where the panels have
  what look very much like portraits of Henry VII. and his queen, Elizabeth
  of York. It goes by the name of the "Sudbury hutch" and was the gift of
  Thomas Sudbury, who was vicar from 1461 to 1504: it is therefore of the
  time of Henry VII. These "portrait cabinets" had a great vogue in the
  reign of Henry VIII., and throughout the sixteenth century. Then come
  three important tombs by Torrigiano, executed between 1509 and 1518, that
  of Henry VII. and his Queen and that of Margaret Beaufort at Westminster
  and that of Dr Young in the Rolls chapel. Almost as early, if not quite
  so, is Prior Eyre's work at Christchurch. Then comes Cardinal Wolsey's
  work at Hampton Court, 1515 to 1525; the beautiful Marney tomb at Layer
  Marney, Essex, 1523; the mortuary chests in the cathedral, and the screen
  work both in the cathedral and in St Cross, Winchester, <i>c.</i> 1525;
  the chantry chapel of Prior Draper at Christchurch, 1529, and that of
  Lady Salisbury, which may be a year or two earlier; and the screen at
  Swine church, Yorkshire, dated 1531. Then follow Henry VIII.'s hall at
  Hampton Court, 1534; and the screen at King's College, Cambridge,
  1533.</p>

  <p>So that the Christchurch work stands very high on the list and
  deserves much more attention than it has received. The general outline of
  the stalls themselves is Gothic, the chief divergency being in the
  supports of the elbow rests and seats. Among the shafts are examples of
  the honeycomb form which is almost the only bit of Renaissance detail in
  the canopies of the Westminster stalls. At the back of the stalls are
  very vigorous carvings of classical dragons, serpents, hounds and human
  faces (<a href="#page76">76</a>). To these last fanciful attributions
  have been made; <i>e.g.</i>, one has been imagined to represent Catharine
  of Arragon between Cardinal Wolsey and Cardinal Campeggio (<a
  href="#page77">77</a>). These portrait busts have a wide distribution;
  they occur in wood, stone and terra cotta. Noble examples are those in
  terra cotta at Hampton Court, which were undoubtedly imported by Cardinal
  Wolsey direct from Italy.<a name="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> Others no doubt are the work of
  Italians resident in England in the first half of the sixteenth century,
  when Italian art and Italian literature were equally the fashion with the
  cognoscenti led by Henry VIII. and Wolsey; <i>e.g.</i>, the fine bust of
  Sir Thomas Lovell by Torrigiano, now in Westminster Abbey.<a
  name="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> These portrait busts have
  a wide range&mdash;from Essex westward to Somerset, Devon and Cornwall;
  <i>e.g.</i>, North Cadbury, Somerset; Lapford, Devon, and Talland,
  Cornwall; several also occur at Hemingborough, Yorkshire. The probability
  is that the Italian artists entered the kingdom at Southampton; and that
  a few found work at Christchurch and in the south-west, but that the main
  body proceeded eastward to Winchester, Basing, London and Layer Marney;
  they have left one memorial at Oxford beneath a window at Christ
  Church.<a name="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a> <!-- Page 78

  <p>Next come the famous screen and stalls of King's College,
  Cambridge&mdash;"the finest woodwork this side of the Alps." Harmonious
  as is the general effect of the stallwork, it was executed at three
  different periods. The stalls were ordered to be made by Henry VI. in his
  will, but were not put up till much later. About 1515 an estimate was
  obtained for 130 stalls, which it was found would cost about £12,000 of
  our money, <i>i.e.</i>, about £92 each. On the screen, which is part of
  the same work, are the arms, badge and initials of Anne Boleyn, who was
  at the height of her influence between 1531 and 1535; the stallwork may
  be ascribed to the same period, but as yet the stalls had plain backs. In
  1633 Mr Thomas Weaver presented the large coats of arms which are seen on
  the backs of the stalls (<a href="#page78">78</a>). The cresting was made
  between 1675 and 1678 by Thomas Austin, following more or less the style
  of the work below.<a name="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a> The
  screen is more completely Italian in treatment than any other work of the
  time, all the moldings being Classic; it is practically certain that the
  general design and most of the work must have been done by Italians. The
  design of screen and stalls alike is to be regarded as an isolated
  example, complete in itself. It did not grow out of anything that went
  before it in England, nor did it develop into anything else in England
  afterwards.<a name="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

  <p>More Classical still in design&mdash;an entablature with architrave,
  frieze and cornice superseding the semicircular arches of the Cambridge
  stalls&mdash;is the superb woodwork at Cartmel, Lancashire. From the
  Dissolution up to 1620, the choir of Cartmel priory church was roofless;
  the canopies of the stalls must have perished; the stalls themselves
  remain, bearing the mark of long exposure to the weather. In 1620 it is
  recorded<a name="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a> that George
  Preston of Holker, who died in 1640, not only reroofed the chancel, "but
  decorated the quire and chancel with a profusion of curiously and
  elaborately carved woodwork" (<a href="#page80">80</a>). <!-- Page 80

  <p>Cartmel was a priory church of Austin Priors, with an income at the
  Dissolution of £90, say £1,000. There are twenty-six stalls; above the
  doorways are inscriptions in gold letters from the Psalms. The architrave
  is supported by shafts which have Corinthian capitals, round which cling
  in delightful fashion delicate tendrils and fruit of the vine. On the
  shafts also are emblems of the Passion; in the illustrations may be
  recognised the cross, the ladder, the buffet, the pillar of scourging,
  the hammer and the nails. At the back is delicate tracery work, reminding
  one of the Gothic tracery of the screen of St Catharine's chapel in
  Carlisle cathedral. The whole design is full of grace and charm; above
  all in the delicate tendrils of the vine coiling round the shafts; one's
  first thought is to class it with the exquisite scrollwork of the
  churches of S. Maria dei Miracoli at Brescia and Venice, and with the
  work of the Italian artists in England in the time of Henry VIII. For as
  a rule, says Mr Gotch,<a name="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>
  "with the close of the first half of the sixteenth century we come to the
  end of pronounced Italian detail such as pervades the tiles at Lacock
  abbey and characterises other isolated features in different parts of the
  country. The nature of the detail in the second half of the sixteenth
  century," and in the seventeenth century, "is different; it no longer
  comprises the dainty cherubs, the elegant balusters" (<i>cf.</i> the
  King's College stalls) "vases and candelabra, the buoyant dolphins and
  delicately modelled foliage which are associated with Italian and French
  Renaissance work, but indulges freely in strapwork curled and interlaced,
  in fruit and foliage, in cartouches and in caryatides, half human beings,
  half pedestals, such as were the delight of the Dutchmen" who had
  superseded the Italian artists. In the Cartmel stalls the one feature
  which is pre-eminently Jacobean is to be seen in the character of the
  busts in the frieze; if they are compared with those at Christchurch (<a
  href="#page77">77</a>), they are seen at once to be of seventeenth and
  not of sixteenth century design. Setting those aside, the design is
  purely that of the Early English Renaissance, as practised by Italian
  artists. It is one of the most remarkable examples of "survival" in
  design in the range of English art, and as beautiful as it is
  belated&mdash;a whole century behind the times. <!-- Page 83 --><span

  <p>In 1697 the choir of St Paul's cathedral was opened for public
  worship. The stalls differ considerably in type from those of
  Pre-Reformation days, as it was necessary to provide seats for the Lord
  Mayor and Corporation of London as well as closets at the back to
  accommodate the wives and families of the canons. By the removal of the
  western screen in the time of Dean Melvill, appointed 1856, the
  appearance of the choir has been completely changed. The exquisite
  carvings of Grinling Gibbons, says Dean Milman,<a name="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a> are not merely admirable in themselves,
  but in perfect harmony with the character of the architecture. He even
  goes so far as to say that they rival, if they do not surpass, all
  mediæval works of their class in grace, variety and richness; and keep up
  an inimitable unison of the lines of the building and the decoration. In
  the words of Horace Walpole, "there is no instance of a man before
  Gibbons who gave to wood the loose and airy lightness of flowers, and
  changed together the various productions of the elements with a fine
  disorder natural to each species." It is doubtful whether Grinling
  Gibbons was of Dutch or English birth. He was discovered by Evelyn in a
  poor solitary thatched house near Sayes Court carving a Crucifixion after
  Tintoretto. In this piece more than a hundred figures were introduced;
  "nor was there anything in nature so tender and delicate as the flowers
  and festoons about it; and yet the work was strong." He asked Evelyn £100
  for it. The frame, says Evelyn, was worth as much. Evelyn introduced "the
  incomparable young man" to the King and to Wren, and his fortune was
  made. Malcolm in his <i>Londinium Redivivum</i> calculates that the
  payments made to Gibbons for his work in St Paul's amounted altogether to
  £1,337. 7s. 5d.<a name="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Space fails to tell of many noble examples of eighteenth century
  stallwork.<a name="NtA_46" href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> In spite of
  an enormous amount of destruction, <i>e.g.</i>, by the vandals in charge
  of Canterbury cathedral, much still remains and awaits the historian. A
  fine drawing of the stallwork put up in 1704 in Canterbury choir will be
  found in Dart's <i>Canterbury</i>. The throne, carved by Grinling
  Gibbons, was given by Archbishop Tenison; the pulpit, two of the stalls
  and other fittings by Queen Mary II.;<a name="NtA_47"
  href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> all this has been swept away, except
  some pieces worked into the return stalls, to make way for stalls of the
  usual brand of Victorian Gothic.</p>

  <p>Stalls are found, but rarely with canopies, in many parochial, as well
  as in monastic, collegiate and cathedral churches. In the latter of
  course the object of them is obvious; they were intended to accommodate a
  large body of monks or canons with their vicars and the choristers. But
  they are found sometimes in the churches of quite small parishes,
  <i>e.g.</i>, Sall, Trunch, Ludham, Burlingham St Edmund's in Norfolk,
  Weston-in-Gordano, Somerset, Norton in Suffolk, Ivychurch<a name="NtA_48"
  href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> in Romney Marsh, where it is pretty
  certain that in most cases the church was served by a single parish
  priest merely. At Ingham, a parish in the Norfolk Broads, there are ten
  stalls in the chancel; at Stowlangtoft, Suffolk, there are six stalls;
  and so with numerous others. How early parochial chancels had stalls is
  difficult to say. No existing examples are earlier than the thirteenth
  century. But a curious fact about the growth of our parish churches, to
  <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page86"></a>{86}</span>which attention has not hitherto been
  directed, may throw some light on the subject. In early Anglo-Saxon days
  the normal and most common type of parish church was one which had an
  aisleless nave and chancel. In early Norman days also this was the most
  common type. In all the above churches, whether Anglo-Saxon or Norman,
  the chancel, whether rectangular or apsidal, was quite small.
  Comparatively few, however, of these chancels remain small. In the vast
  majority of cases they have been enlarged. Either the old chancel has
  been retained but has been lengthened, or it has been broadened as well
  as lengthened, thus producing an entirely new chancel. In most cases it
  happened that, in the long history of the church, aisles were thrown out
  afterwards, or transepts, that later the nave was lengthened westwards
  and was heightened to accommodate clerestory windows, and still later a
  western tower was added and perhaps a spire. But the enlargement of the
  chancel sometimes took place without any of the other alterations, and
  where that is so, <i>i.e.</i>, where the church retains a comparatively
  small nave, the enlarged chancel bulks up very lofty and spacious,
  seemingly quite out of scale to the rest of the church: in some examples
  the chancel is actually loftier than the nave. A church with a chancel so
  disproportionate strikes the attention at once as one demanding
  explanation. Large numbers of such abnormally big chancels survive. In
  Kent and Sussex many of them are of the thirteenth century; <i>e.g.</i>,
  Littlebourne; while over England one is struck with the very large number
  of lofty and spacious chancels of the fourteenth century; <i>e.g.</i>,
  Norbury, Derbyshire; Oulton, Suffolk. In numerous cases the enlargements
  of the chancel took place more than once. At Boston the church was
  rebuilt with a fine chancel <i>c.</i> 1330; but by the end of the century
  even this vast chancel was judged inadequate, and it was extended still
  further to the east.</p>

<p><!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"></a>{88}</span></p>

  <p>What then is the explanation of this furore for enlargement of
  chancels? In considering the answer, it must be borne in mind that,
  ritualistically, the English parish church was always tripartite;
  consisting of nave, choir and chancel. In churches of the Iffley type,
  <i>i.e.</i>, with a central tower, it was also architecturally
  tripartite. But even in churches which architecturally were bipartite,
  <i>i.e.</i>, which consisted merely of a nave and chancel, the chancel
  was divided into two parts, choir and sanctuary, the distinction between
  them being marked by a change of level. Which part then was it that was
  found inadequate, the sanctuary or the choir? Not the former; it was not
  then cumbered with altar rails; the purpose they serve nowadays was
  served by the screen which every church possessed, guarding the entrance
  to the chancel; and the sanctuary was quite large enough for the
  celebrant at the Mass, with as a rule a solitary assistant, the parish
  clerk. It must have been the choir that was too small for the seats which
  it was desired to place in it. We conclude therefore that seats were
  common even in small village churches as early as the thirteenth century,
  if not before. Documentary evidence to that effect we have not. But in
  later days there is definite evidence as to the practice of putting
  stalls in the chancels of parish churches. In Hemingborough church,
  Yorkshire, there remain stalls of graceful thirteenth century design (<a
  href="#page87">87</a>). Now this church in the thirteenth century was
  parochial; it did not become collegiate till 1426. A series of entries of
  the cost of choir stalls is preserved for the parish church of St Mary at
  Hill in the City of London. In the year 1426 there was "paid to three
  carpenters for the stalls of the quire, 20d." In the following year there
  was paid "for the stalls of the quire" the large sum of £12 (= £150); it
  would seem that it was about this time that a complete new set of stalls
  was put into the choir. In the same year, 1427, there was "paid for
  stalls in the quire, 16s. 6d."; and "for a quire stool, 7s. 10d." In 1501
  a payment was made "for mending of desks in the quire"; in 1509 "for
  nails and mending of a bench in the quire, 1d." In 1523 there was "paid
  for a long desk for the quire, 3s."; in 1526 "for the stuff and making of
  a double desk in the quire, 5s." Then, in Protestant days, there was
  "paid for mending the desk and settles in the chancel, 2s." At this
  church the lower part of the bench was made to form a box or chest. <!--

    <p style="text-align:center">Hereford St Peter's</p>
  </div>

  <p>Who then sat in these stalls? The common theory is that they were
  intended for the use of the rector or vicar and the parish clerk, and of
  any chantry priests who might be attached to the church. This no doubt is
  true as far as it goes. At St Maurice, York, a complaint was made at the
  visitation in 1416 to the effect that the desks in the choir, viz., those
  where the parish chaplain and the parish clerk were wont to sit, are
  unhandsome and in need of repair: "Dicunt quod deski in choro, tam ex una
  parte quam ex alia, ubi saltem capellanus parochialis et clericus
  parochialis sedere usi sunt, nimis deformes et indigent reparacione."<a
  name="NtA_49" href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> To many churches also,
  but by no means to all, chantry endowments were made; <i>i.e.</i>, money
  was left that masses might be said for ever for the repose of the soul of
  the donor by a priest, other than the rector or vicar, specially
  appointed for that purpose. It is commonly supposed that these chantry
  priests were concerned only with the special altars at which they
  ministered. But that this was not the case, at any rate universally, is
  apparent from the terms of the institution of the Willeby chantry in
  Halifax parish church. The deed is dated 10th June 1494. Amongst other
  regulations it contains the provision that the chaplain is to attend in
  person in the choir of the church on every Sunday and Holy Day in his
  surplice, at matins, mass and vespers, and to take his part in the
  reading and chanting, as directed by the vicar, and in accordance with
  the constitutions of the Metropolitan Church. "Item volo et ordino quod
  predictus Tho. Gledhill, Capellanus modernus, et omnes alii Capellani,
  ... temporibus futuris nominandi, singulis diebus dominicis et festivis
  personaliter sint presentes in choro ejusdem Ecclesie temporibus
  matutinarum missarum et vesperarum, suis suppeliciis induti, et legant et
  psallent, prout Vicario ejusdem Ecclesie pro tempore existenti decenter
  et congrue videbitur expedire, ut in constitutionibus Ecclesie
  Metropolitane proinde constitutis plenius liquet." Assuming <!-- Page 90
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>{90}</span>then that the
  same rule applied also to the incumbents of the other chantries, there
  would be a regular body of clergy to take part in the choir offices.<a
  name="NtA_50" href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Instances might be multiplied to any extent of the obligation laid on
  chantry priests to attend and assist the rector or vicar in the services.
  Thus at Rothwell in 1494 the chantry priest attached to the altar of Our
  Lady was not only required by the foundation deed to celebrate Mass and
  other service daily at this altar, but was directed to be in the high
  choir all festival days at matins, Mass, and evensong. In 1505 Margaret
  Blade, widow, endowed a chantry of Our Lady in Kildewick parish for a
  priest who, in addition to his special duties, was to help Divine service
  in the choir and to help the curate in time of necessity.<a name="NtA_51"
  href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> Sometimes quite a considerable number
  of chantry priests were attached to a parish church. When all chantry
  endowments were confiscated by Edward VI., the loss of the services of
  the chantry priests was in many cases severely felt. At Nottingham indeed
  the parishioners of St Mary's made formal protest; stating that in their
  parish there were "1,400 houseling people and that the vicar there had no
  other priest to help but the two chantry priests."<a name="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> We may take it therefore that seats in
  the chancel were required not only for the parish priest and the parish
  clerk, but in some cases for chantry priests as well.</p>

  <p>But the above explanation does not cover the whole ground. There are
  often many more stalls than could be used as above. And in some churches
  there were no chantry priests at all, and yet there are stalls. Who else
  then occupied seats in the chancel? Some of the stalls probably, usually
  but a few, may have been occupied by laymen even so early as the
  thirteenth century. <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a

    <p style="text-align:center">Stowlangtoft</p>
  </div>

  <p>As regards the occupancy of seats in the chancel it is quite clear
  that it has always been the wish of the Church that they should be
  reserved for the clergy and that no laymen should be admitted. It is
  equally clear that the Church has never been able to carry out the
  injunction. In the Trullan Council of 683 or 692 it was laid down, "Nulli
  omnium liceat, qui quidem sit in laicorum numero, intra septa sacri
  altaris ingredi, nequaquam tamen ab eo prohibita potestate et auctoritate
  imperiali, quandoquidem voluerit Creatori dona offerre, ex antiquissima
  traditione"; <i>i.e.</i>, "No layman may enter the chancel, except the
  Emperor, who by venerable tradition is allowed to do so when he wishes to
  present offerings to his Maker." But this does not explicitly allow the
  Emperor to sit down in the chancel. And even this much was objected to by
  many; for a gloss follows: "Nemo liceat laico intra, &amp;c." ...
  "Adulatione et timore victi, per gravem errorem concedunt imperatori,
  quod magna cum laude sanctorum patrum Ambrosius Theodosio negavit";
  <i>i.e.</i>, "The permission given to the Emperor was given under the
  influence of adulation and timidity, and the action of St Ambrose in
  refusing it to the Emperor Theodosius was greatly applauded by the
  Fathers." But it was a perilous thing to exclude emperors, and what was
  conceded to emperors was claimed by princes, and what was conceded to
  princes was claimed by and had to be conceded to the nobility generally.
  So in Scotland in 1225 by an episcopal order the King and his nobles also
  were allowed to stand and to sit in the chancel: "Ne laici secus altare,
  quum sacra mysteria celebrantur, stare vel sedere inter clericos
  presumant, excepto domino rege et majoribus regni, quibus propter suam
  excellentiam in hac parte duximus referendum." And if the nobles, then
  certainly the patron of the living could not be excluded from a parochial
  chancel. So in the diocese of Worcester in 1240 a canon was agreed to
  that patrons as well as high personages might stand in the chancel: "nec
  laici stent in Cancellis dum celebrantur divina; salva tamen reverentia
  patronorum et sublimium personarum"; in Lincoln diocese also Bishop
  Grosstête in 1240 restricts the permission to the patron. Again in 1255
  in Lincoln diocese the patron or any other "venerable" person was allowed
  to sit and stand in the chancel. Archbishop Greenfield of York
  (1304-1315) found it necessary to make a rule against laymen intruding
  into the choir during service. So also at Ely, Simon Langham in 1364
  wrote: "Lay people are not to stand or sit amongst the clerks in the
  chancel during the celebration of divine service, unless <!-- Page 92
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>{92}</span>it be done to
  shew respect or for some other reasonable and obvious reason; but this is
  allowed for the patrons of churches only."<a name="NtA_53"
  href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> Then what had been claimed successfully
  by those of noble birth, and by patrons in particular, was claimed with
  equal success by any good Churchman of consideration and wealth,
  especially if he were a benefactor of the church. For in the fourteenth
  century Alan de Alnewyk of York, goldsmith, wills that his body be buried
  <i>in the quire</i> of St Michael Belfry near the place <i>where I used
  to sit</i> ("ubi sedere solebam"). Another century later, Robert
  Constable of Bossall, leaves this direction in 1454: "First, I devise my
  soul to God Almighty and his mother Blessed Saint Mary and to Saint
  Botolph and to the holy court of heaven; and my body to be buried in the
  quire afore the place <i>where my seat is</i>."<a name="NtA_54"
  href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a> In 1511 Robert Fabyan, the chronicler,
  citizen and draper of London, devises as follows: "I will that my corps
  be buried between my pew and the high altar, <i>within the quire</i> of
  the church of Allhallows, Theydon Gardon, Essex." Finally, at Yatton,
  Somerset, in 1529, 2s. was "paid for a sege in ye chaunsell."<a
  name="NtA_55" href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> It is to be remembered
  moreover that though it may have been unusual for laymen to have seats in
  the chancel, yet it was by no means uncommon for them to stand or kneel
  there; there are enough representations of laymen so standing to
  establish that point satisfactorily: they are shewn standing or kneeling,
  sometimes with lighted tapers in their hands. At a St Martin's mass in
  France in the fourteenth century,<a name="NtA_56"
  href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> two women are shewn near the altar
  steps, one standing and attending to her duties, the other inattentive
  and seriously distracting the attention of an acolyte kneeling near. We
  know definitely that in Salisbury cathedral laymen were allowed to be
  present in the sanctuary before the Sunday procession; for after the
  hallowing of the water it was ordered that the priest should asperge the
  laity in the presbytery as well as the clergy in the choir. "Post
  aspersionem clericorum laicos in presbiterio hinc inde stantes
  aspergat."<a name="NtA_57" href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> At Salisbury
  the Sunday procession was marshalled in the ample space between the choir
  and the high altar, which space the laity entered in order to follow the
  clerks in the procession. <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>For women it was more difficult to get admission to the chancel.
  Tradition and usage were against them. As early as <span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 367 the Council of Laodicea passed a canon that
  women ought not to come near the altar or enter the apartment where the
  altar stands. In the ninth century a canon was passed at Mantes that
  women must not approach the altar or act as "server" to the celebrant or
  stand in the chancel. Among the canons of the time of King Edgar is one:
  "Docemus ut altari mulier non appropinquet dum Missa celebratur"; "a
  woman must not come near the altar at Mass." In laying down regulations
  for the services in Ripon Minster Archbishop Greenfield says, "We permit
  no women at all, religious or secular, unless great ladies or ladies of
  high rank or others of approved honour and piety, to sit or stand in a
  stall or elsewhere in the choir while the divine offices are being
  celebrated." "Nullas omnino mulieres, religiosas vel seculares, nec
  laicos nisi magnas aut nobiles <!-- Page 94 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page94"></a>{94}</span>personas aut alias quarum sit honestas et
  devocio satis nota, in stallo vel alibi in choro inter ministros
  ecclesiae stare vel sedere dum divina celebrantur officia permittimus."<a
  name="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> The story told about Sir
  Thomas More shews that while he himself sat in the chancel, Lady More sat
  in the nave. "During his high Chancellorship one of his gentlemen, when
  service at the church was done, ordinarily used to come to my Lady his
  wife's pew-door and say unto her 'Madame, my Lord is gone.' But the next
  holy day after the surrender of his office of Lord Chancellor, and the
  departure of his gentlemen from him, he came unto my Lady his wife's pew
  himself, and, making a low courtesy, said unto her, 'Madam, my Lord is
  gone.' But she, thinking this at first to be but one of his jokes, was
  little moved, till he told her sadly he had given up the Great Seal." And
  many other good Churchmen at all times have retained the ancient usage of
  the exclusion of women from the stalls in the chancel. At Great Burstead,
  in Essex, in 1661, an applicant was authorised to build a pew at the
  entrance to the chancel for the use of himself and sons and companions
  and friends of the male sex; but to build another in the nave for his
  wife and her daughters and companions and friends of the female sex. King
  Charles I. in 1625 wrote, "For mine own particular opinion I do not think
  ... that Women should be allowed to sit in the chancel, which was
  instituted for Clerks"; and in 1633, when he visited Durham cathedral,
  the choir was cleared of all the seats occupied by the Mayor and
  Corporation and the wives of the Dean and Prebendaries and other "women
  of quality," and his Majesty gave orders that they should never again be
  erected, "that so the Quire may ever remain in its ancient beauty." Even
  to this day in some cathedrals it is the usage to allow women to sit only
  in the lower desks of the choir and not in the stalls above. Nevertheless
  in plenty of instances the pertinacity of women prevailed; and where the
  husband sat in the chancel, there the wife insisted on sitting beside
  him. Thus in a suit instituted by Lady Wyche in 1468, the lady put it on
  record that she had a seat in the chancel: "jeo aye un lieu de seer en le
  chauncel." In 1468 two ladies had seats in the chancel of Rotherham
  church; for the master of the grammar school willed that he be buried in
  south chancel<a name="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> near the
  stall in which the wife of the Bailiff of Rotherham and the testator's
  wife sit. In 1553 a new pew was made for Sir Arthur D'Arcy and his wife
  at St Botolph, Aldgate: "Paid to Mattram, carpenter, for three elm <!--
  Page 95 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>{95}</span>boards
  for the two new pews in the quire where Sir Arthur Darsey and his wife
  are set ... ijs. viijd." The same parish in 1587 gave Master Dove
  permission to "build a pew for himself, another for his wife to sit in,
  being in the chancel." Therefore we come to the conclusion that at any
  rate from the thirteenth century onward more and more seats were provided
  in the chancel for lay folk. Where, as in the parish church of Boston,
  the stalls are very numerous&mdash;at Boston there are
  sixty-four&mdash;it is likely that a considerable number of them were
  appropriated to various important gilds connected with the church.</p>

  <p>But there is another purpose which parochial stalls subserved, and
  that is the most important of all: viz., to accommodate a surpliced
  choir. The introduction of surpliced choirs into chancels in modern days
  was an innovation at first deeply resented, and seems to have been
  usually made in ignorance of the existence of mediæval precedent.
  Precedent there is, however, in abundance. England was a merry, tuneful
  land before the Reformation, and nowhere more than in the churches. The
  musical part of the service grew more and more ornate, especially in the
  last years immediately preceding the Dissolution; the
  parishes&mdash;village and town parishes alike&mdash;delighted in "the
  cheerful noise of organs and fiddles and anthems," and spent on music a
  very large part of the church income. The early years of the sixteenth
  century were a glorious time for church music; the parishioners loved it
  and would have it, and were willing to pay for it; it was not forced on
  them from above; it was the people and the people's churchwardens who
  would have it. What a joyful sound we should hear from the church doors
  if we could enter once more an English church of the sixteenth century
  and hear the surpliced men and boys a singing in the choir, accompanied
  by organs and citterns and fiddles and crowdes and dulcimers and all
  instruments of music in the rood loft, with perhaps an anthem or a solo
  on high festival days from distinguished vocalists of the neighbouring
  villages; those were happy times. Take the churchwardens' accounts of St
  Mary at Hill, London.<a name="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a>
  In this church in 1523 there was "paid 15d. for 6 round mats of wicker
  for the clerks." If we assume six more for the boys, we get a regular
  choir of six men and six boys. But besides these an extra choir of
  choirmen and boys was engaged for special days. In 1527 there was "paid
  9d. at the Sun tavern for the drinking of Mr Colmas and others of the
  King's chapel <!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page96"></a>{96}</span>that had sung in the church of St Mary at
  Hill." In 1553 there was "paid 16d. to the gentlemen of the Queen's
  chapel for singing a mass at St Mary at Hill." Again, in 1527 there was
  "paid 7s. for bread, ale and wine for the quire, and for strangers at
  divers feasts in the year past"; these "strangers" would probably be
  singers hired from other churches. The above entry shews that the choir
  was paid in kind as well as in money. The choirmen received quite
  handsome salaries. In 1524 Morres, the bass, was receiving from the
  parish 20 nobles a year. John Hobbes was the most expensive member of the
  choir. In 1556 there was paid to John Hobbes 56s. 8d., being one
  quarter's wages, for his services in the choir. This choirman therefore
  had a salary of £11. 6s. 8d. per annum, which would be equivalent to
  about £113 of our money. Sir John Parkyns, a bass, received a quarterly
  salary of 15s. 8d. "for the help the quire when Hobbes was dead, and to
  have 8d. a day every holy day and Sunday." On the other hand there was
  "paid 12s. to Mr Hilton, priest, for three quarters of a year, for
  keeping daily service in the quire in 1528"; this was at the rate of 16s.
  per annum; this compares remarkably with John Hobbes' salary of £11. 6s.
  8d. per annum; even allowing for the fact that Mr Hilton had other
  sources of revenue, we cannot but infer that priests were cheap and good
  singers dear in the sixteenth century. The parishes were quite willing to
  pay for good music. At Braunton, Devon, <i>c.</i> 1580, <i>i.e.</i>,
  after the Reformation, the churchwardens were still paying four or five
  expensive choirmen, as well as singing boys; the highest salary for a
  choirman was 26s. 8d.; say £13. 6s. 8d. per annum; the choir in this
  village church could not have cost the parish less than £100 per annum of
  our money. In all the choirs there seem to have been "singing boys" as
  well as men. We hear in 1477 of four choristers being brought over to St
  Mary at Hill for a special service, for which they received the modest
  sum of 1d. each. At this church it was finally arranged to have a
  permanent choir, and what we should call a choir school was established,
  with John Norfolk, the organist, at the head of it to train the boys: for
  there "was paid for making clean of a chamber in the Abbot's Inn to be a
  school for Norfolk's children." The same year "Mr parson gave the boys a
  playing week to make merry," and the churchwardens kindly presented the
  boys and choirmen with 3s. 4d. to spend on their holiday. Next year there
  was again a payment of 3s. 4d. "in the playing week after Christmas to
  disport them." Both the boys and the men wore surplices, bought at the
  expense of the parish. In 1496 there were at St Mary at Hill "8 surplices
  for the quire, of which <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page97"></a>{97}</span>2 have no sleeves; and 7 rochets for
  children, and 6 albs for children." In 1499 there was "paid 12d. for the
  making of 6 rochets for children that were in the quire." At St
  Nicholas', Bristol, in 1521 there was paid "1d. for making a child's
  surplice belonging to the quire"; and in 1542 iiis. viid. for material
  "to make 2 lads' surplices." An inventory of Huntingfield church,
  Suffolk, shews that the church possessed "vii rochettys ffor men and vii
  for chyldern," and that the material of the rochets cost 6d. each; it
  would seem that this Suffolk village had seven men and seven boys in the
  church choir. At St Mary at Hill there was paid in 1523 "for making 12
  surplices for men at 6d. each, 6s.; and for 12 surplices for children at
  5d. each, 5s."; this was a rich city parish, and could afford to have a
  pair for each choir man and boy, one to be in use, the other at the wash.
  Then music had to be paid for. In the same church in 1523 there was paid
  "for 4 hymnals and a processioner, noted, for the clerks in the quire,
  6s. 8d."; in the same year there was paid "for two quires of paper to
  prick songs in, 8d." In 1555 at St Mary the Great, Cambridge, there was
  "paid 3s. 4d. for the copy of the service in English set out by note; and
  1s. 4d. for writing and noting part of it to sing on both sides of the
  quire"; <i>i.e.</i>, they sang antiphonally. There are numerous entries
  as to the cost of the organ and of the constant repairs which it
  required. Lastly, there was the organist's salary, which if it was
  anything like the sum received by John Hobbes, would be a heavy item. An
  eminent organist like John Norfolk, who was in charge of a choir school,
  would expect and no doubt get a large salary. In village churches,
  however, the boys would be trained, sometimes by a chantry priest if he
  was under statutory obligation to do so, more often by the parish clerk.
  The latter was a permanent official with a freehold, as he is still, and
  a person of much importance and dignity. Before the Reformation, in
  addition to serving at the daily Mass in a village church, carrying holy
  water and "blessed bread" round the parish, and many other functions, he
  was more especially in charge of the musical part of the services. He was
  expected to sing or chant himself, especially the psalms; he had to read
  the epistles; and, at any rate in the sixteenth century, he had to train
  the choir boys. It was ordered at Faversham in 1506 that "the clerks, or
  one of them, so much as in them is, shall endeavour themselves to teach
  children to read and sing in the quire." And at St Giles', Reading, in
  1544 there was a payment of 12s. "to Whitborne the clerk towards his
  wages, and he to be bound to teach 2 children for the quire."</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Hambleton</p>
  </div>

  <p>Beside the professional choirmen and the parish clerks there were
  sometimes amateurs also giving help. Sir Thomas More used to sing in
  Chelsea church like any parish clerk. "God's body," said the Duke of
  Norfolk, coming on a time to Chelsea and finding him in Chelsea church,
  singing at Mass in the choir, "God's body, my Lord Chancellor, what
  turned parish clerk?" Put these items together&mdash;the wages of
  choirmen and boys, and now and then of extra help, the making, mending
  and washing of surplices, the cost of music, the salaries of the organist
  and parish clerk and the cost of the choir school, and it will be seen
  that the services of a large town church must have been, musically, on
  quite a grand scale; it is equally plain that the love of church music
  and the willingness to pay for it were equally great in the villages. It
  is not possible here to go further into this matter of the church music.
  It may be said briefly, however, that the plain chant of the Divine
  Office and of the Mass would be sung in the chancel, and that for this
  the permanent village choir of men and boys would suffice. Every parish
  that could afford it seems to have had a rood loft and an organ in it.
  But the organ would not be used to accompany the plain song, but for what
  we call "voluntaries" in the various intervals of the Mass and other
  services. The <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page99"></a>{99}</span>organ again would be employed when there was
  singing of "motets," <i>i.e.</i>, anthems, whether the singers were in
  the choir or the rood loft. On great days when minstrels playing all
  manner of instruments were got together to help out the organ, they would
  no doubt be placed in the rood loft, with any extra vocalists for whom
  place could not be found in the choir below.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Chaddesden</p>

  <p>Summing up, we may say that in a parochial chancel seats were required
  (1) for the parish priest, the parish clerk and any chaplains or chantry
  priests; (2) for the patron and a few of the leading churchfolk of the
  village; (3) for a choir of men and boys which was occasionally enlarged
  by choirmen and choristers borrowed from neighbouring churches.
  Altogether quite a considerable number of seats would be required; and we
  need not be surprised that there are so many stalls in small village
  churches, but rather that they are not more; no doubt, however,
  additional forms or benches would be introduced on days of great
  festival.</p>

  <p>Not every parish church could afford to have a set of stalls made,
  cathedral fashion, for its chancel. In many cases probably the seats were
  but benches or settles; and the naked, desolate <!-- Page 100 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>{100}</span>look of many spacious
  chancels is no doubt due to the removal of these seats. Desks, or as they
  were Latinised "deski," there must have been, at least one at each side,
  on which to place the anthem book, processioner and other music. We hear
  of a double desk at St Mary at Hill; but only the richest parishes seem
  to have provided desks for the choir boys as well as for the men. In poor
  parishes the men had not armed stalls, but merely a bench to sit on.<a
  name="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> The boys sometimes had a
  bench; sometimes, as at Stowlangtoft, Suffolk (<a href="#page91">91</a>),
  the bench was framed into the desk behind. At the back of the choirmen's
  seats, there might be bare wall; or it might be panelled, as at Sall,
  Norfolk (<a href="#page85">85</a>), or arcaded, as at Chichester
  Cathedral (<a href="#page36">36</a>). In richer examples there might be
  above the panelling a coved cornice, as at Stowlangtoft and Balsham,
  Cambridge (<a href="#page3">3</a>). A still more sumptuous design was to
  erect a horizontal canopy above the stalls, as at St Peter's (<a
  href="#page89">89</a>) and All Saints' (<a href="#page45">45</a>),
  Hereford, and Brancepeth, John Cosin's church, Durham (<a
  href="#page93">93</a>). The return stalls, facing east, would be those of
  the parish priest and his clerical helpers, and were often more spacious
  and lofty than the rest, and backed on to the screen, as at Chaddesden,
  Derbyshire (<a href="#page99">99</a>), and Trunch, Norfolk (<a
  href="#page85">85</a>).</p>

  <p>The workmanship of the best stalls is quite first rate. At All
  Saints', Hereford, the timber of the stalls is "good sound English oak,
  all either cleft or cut in the quarter, proving that the trees were
  converted into the smallest possible sizes before being sawn from either
  end, the very rough saw-kerfs meeting at an angle in the centre of the
  board."<a name="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> The stalls
  frequently stand on stone plinths, pierced for ventilation; <i>e.g.</i>,
  at Sall and Trunch (<a href="#page85">85</a>).</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAPTER VII</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">BISHOPS' THRONES</p>

  <p>In the next chapter we deal with movable chairs and thrones,
  descendants more or less of the "<i>sella curulis</i>" and the "<i>sella
  gestatoria</i>." More important still are the fixed thrones of Early
  Christian days. These were not of wood or ivory, but of masonry, usually
  marble. In shape they were just high-backed chairs of marble. Now
  countless numbers of such marble chairs or stalls were in use in the
  theatres, thermæ and amphitheatres of Pagan Rome; the thermæ of Caracalla
  alone possessed 600 such marble stalls. Doubtless many a bishop's throne,
  like those at St John Lateran, St Clement and Cosmedin, Rome, was
  actually taken from one of the Roman thermæ. Similar bishops' chairs, cut
  out of the solid rock, occur in the catacombs of Rome.</p>

  <p>The position of the fixed marble throne of an Early Christian bishop
  was high up in the centre of the back wall of the apse of the church.</p>

  <p>In Dalmatia and Istria several thrones retain their original position.
  At Parenzo there remains the semicircle of marble seats for the clergy
  with the episcopal throne in the centre; a work of the first half of the
  sixth century. At Aquileia, in the centre of the east end, is the
  Patriarch's throne of veined white marble, inlaid with serpentine; it is
  made up of portions of an older throne of genuine Byzantine work. At
  Grado the marble throne at the east end of the church seems to have been
  made up in the ninth century; it is surmounted by a stone tester. At Zara
  in the same position is another marble chair, raised on five steps. At
  Trau the bench of the clergy remains, but the bishop's throne has been
  destroyed. At Ossero also is a marble throne made up of fragments of
  older work.<a name="NtA_63" href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> In the apse
  of the twelfth century church of S. Stefano, Bologna, is a bishop's
  throne ten steps above the choir. Another remains <i>in situ</i> in
  Vaison cathedral, Provence. Another episcopal chair of marble is now
  placed on the north side of the sanctuary of Avignon cathedral; on it are
  carved the emblems of the Evangelists (<a href="#page104">104</a>). <!--

  <p>In the Victoria and Albert Museum is a throne, painted and gilded,
  dated 1779, from a church in Cyprus. In Norwich cathedral in the centre
  of the apse wall of the presbytery there are the fragments of the
  original stone seat built for the use of the bishop, and on the pavement
  and adjoining piers there are traces of the steps by which his throne was
  reached. When Blomfield wrote his <i>History of Norfolk</i>, 1739-1775,
  the steps of the throne had not been disturbed; "the ancient bishop's
  throne ascended by three steps," and when built, before a rood screen was
  erected, the bishop had an uninterrupted view down the whole church to
  the west end of the nave.<a name="NtA_64"

  <p>In Canterbury cathedral is a stone chair, which as at Norwich was
  originally at the back of the High altar; it was removed from that
  position by Archbishop Howley <i>c.</i> 1840, but has recently been
  replaced; it consists of three blocks of Purbeck marble (<a
  href="#page105">105</a>). The chronicler Eadmer, writing of the
  Pre-Conquest cathedral burnt down in 1067, says that "the pontifical
  chair in it was constructed with handsome workmanship and of large stones
  and cement." The description would apply very well to the present chair:
  but the monk Gervase states that in Lanfranc's cathedral, finished in
  1077, "the patriarchal seat, on which the archbishops were wont to sit
  during the solemnities of the Mass, until the consecration of the
  Sacrament, was of a single stone." It would seem therefore that the
  Anglo-Saxon chair perished in the fire of 1067, and that its successor
  experienced the same fate in 1174. The probability is therefore that the
  present chair was made between the fire of 1174 and the consecration of
  1184. A decisive argument against a Pre-Conquest date is the fact that
  the throne is made of Purbeck marble&mdash;for this material seems not to
  have come into use till after the middle of the twelfth century in the
  Norman house at Christchurch on the Avon, in St Cross', Winchester, and
  in William of Sens' work at Canterbury. <!-- Page 105 --><span

  <p>The position of the pontifical throne at Canterbury has varied at
  different periods. Eadmer states that the cathedral burnt down in 1067
  was orientated to the east, where was the presbytery containing the High
  altar. But at the west end of the church was the altar of Our Lady, and
  behind this altar was the throne adjoining the west wall. This unusual
  position is only explicable by the assumption that the first cathedral at
  Canterbury was orientated to the west, and that the site occupied in 1067
  by the altar of Our Lady was originally that of the High altar. The
  western position so postulated for the High altar and the throne was
  originally that of most of the Early Christian basilicas at Rome, in
  particular the ancient basilica of St Peter. At a later period the
  orientation was often reversed, <i>e.g.</i>, in St Paul <i>extra
  muros</i>, Rome; what happened in this latter church seems also to have
  happened in Anglo-Saxon times at Canterbury. A similar change has
  occurred in the French cathedral of Nevers; where, however, though in
  Gothic days a presbytery and High altar were constructed at the east end
  of the church, the early <!-- Page 106 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page106"></a>{106}</span>Romanesque presbytery, crypt, and two bays
  of the nave have been allowed to remain to this day.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Beverley Minster</p>
  </div>

  <p>What looks like a survival of the marble chair of the bishop is to be
  seen in the frithstols of Hexham and Beverley (<a
  href="#page106">106</a>). These also are of masonry, and are so similar
  in design to the ancient marble thrones that one is tempted to speculate
  that the original usage of sanctuary was for the offender to fly to and
  occupy the actual throne of the bishop or archbishop.</p>

  <p>As has been said, in the Early Christian churches both the altar and
  the seats of the bishop and his clergy were usually at the west end of
  the church to the west of the High altar, so that the clergy faced
  towards the east, while the congregation faced towards the west. But
  early examples occur of churches with the modern orientation. When this
  was the case, the congregation faced east; and where the ancient position
  of the throne and benches was retained, the clergy were left in an
  anomalous position facing west. This led, first to the clergy, then the
  bishop, migrating elsewhere. The higher clergy took up their position in
  the return stalls of the choir, facing east; the lower clergy occupied
  stalls north and south of the choir. As for the bishop, he could not seat
  himself as before, facing the altar, for his throne would have blocked
  the entrance into the presbytery. He therefore set up his throne on the
  south side of the choir, at the eastern end of the southern range of
  stalls. And this is where we find him in Gothic days. There is one chief
  exception. In cathedrals served by monks, the bishop was the titular
  abbot of the house, though the superintendence of the monastery had
  necessarily to be left mainly in the hands of the prior; and so to this
  day in some churches the bishop has no throne, but occupies the ancient
  abbot's stall&mdash;at Ely the stall of the Benedictine abbot, at
  Carlisle the stall of the Augustinian abbot.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The change of position from the back of the High altar to the front of
  it was a complete break with tradition. Equally complete was the break in
  design. In the design of the Gothic throne there is no reminiscence
  whatever of the marble chairs of the Early Christian basilicas and the
  Pagan Thermæ. The Gothic thrones are but glorified versions of such
  stalls and spirelet-tabernacles as those of Lincoln; they are spacious
  stalls, sometimes, as at St David's, big enough to hold a bishop and two
  chaplains, and crowned with a spire of open woodwork. The earliest and
  grandest is that of Exeter cathedral; the Fabric Rolls shew that in 1312
  during the episcopate of Bishop Stapledon there was paid "for timber for
  the bishop's seat £6. 12s. 8½d." The oak was kept four years before it
  was used. Then £4 was paid to Robert de Galmeton "for making the bishop's
  seat by contract." There was also a charge of 30s. for <!-- Page 108
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>{108}</span>painting, and
  there must have been one for carving the statues in the canopy. The whole
  cost would be about £13; say £200 in our money; a sum surprisingly small
  for work of such magnitude and delicate detail. The throne was evidently
  intended to have a chair placed under it, and probably seats for the
  bishop's chaplains to the right and left. It is 57 feet high; at present
  its niches look somewhat unsubstantial and meagre; but that is because
  all the niches were tenanted with statues, and all have disappeared. The
  carved foliage is of exceptional excellence, and the corners of the
  pinnacles are occupied with small heads of oxen, sheep, dogs, pigs,
  monkeys and other animals (<a href="#page102">102</a>).</p>

  <p>Not much later is the throne in Hereford cathedral. That at Wells is
  fifteenth century work, and by a pretty fancy of the "restorers" its
  tracery is filled with modern plate glass, and the door is a solid
  swinging stone! That at St David's is nearly 30 feet high. Of the throne
  erected by Bishop Gower <i>c.</i> 1342 there remains <i>in situ</i> only
  the low partition surrounding it; the present throne was probably put up
  by Bishop Morgan between 1496 and 1504 (<a href="#page109">109</a>).<a
  name="NtA_65" href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The throne at Durham is of masonry, and in two parts of different
  dates. The lower portion contains an altar tomb surmounted by a recumbent
  effigy of the bishop in richly worked robes beneath a rich lierne vault.
  No doubt Bishop Hatfield as usual put this up during his lifetime; he was
  bishop from 1345 to 1381. This lower part is an exquisite example of the
  design in vogue before the advent of the Black Death of 1349-50. On the
  tomb is the pulpit, which bears unmistakable marks of the change of style
  which became general after 1350. The drawing shews the throne as it was
  in 1843 (<a href="#page107">107</a>).</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAIRS IN CHURCHES</p>

  <p>Hardly anything in a cathedral has so venerable a history as the
  throne and chair of the Bishop, of wood or ivory. The origin of this type
  of Bishop's chair goes back to Pagan Rome. There the greater officials
  had two official chairs, both portable; one, the "<i>sella curulis</i>"
  in which they sat while administering justice; the other, the "<i>sella
  gestatoria</i>" in which they were carried in procession. The "<i>sella
  curulis</i>" was a folding chair with crossed legs like the chair of
  Dagobert in the Hotel Cluny, Paris: chairs of this form are still in use
  in many Continental cathedrals.</p>

  <p>The "<i>sella gestatoria</i>" was a kind of sedan chair, shaped like a
  settle; with high back and usually without arms; it was provided with
  rings through which were passed staves when it was borne in procession.
  Similar is the Pope's chair in St Peter's, Rome, last shewn in 1867 (<a
  href="#page112">112</a>). It is said to have belonged to the Senator
  Pudens and to have been used by St Peter. Whether that be so or not, it
  is undoubtedly very ancient, and its legs may be of the Apostolic age;
  they are of yellow oak, worm-eaten, and chipped by pilgrims who carried
  away bits as relics; the seat and back are of acacia wood and are of a
  later period. This back is ornamented with ivory panels carved to
  represent the Labours of Hercules; the panels are probably of the ninth
  century, for among the decorations is a bust with a crown bearing
  <i>fleurs de lis</i>, and what seems to be a portrait of Charles the
  Bald.<a name="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Very similar is
  the chair in which St Silvester is represented as seated in the dome of
  the apse of St John Lateran, where the mosaics are those of 1291, copied
  probably from the original ones executed in 428. Similar chairs also
  appear in the mosaics of Sta. Pudentiana and other Roman basilicas, and
  in those of Santa Sophia, Constantinople. <!-- Page 112 --><span

  <p>In the Archbishop's chapel at Ravenna is preserved a chair made for
  Maximian who was Archbishop of Ravenna from 546 to 556. It is in wood
  entirely covered with plaques of ivory, arranged in panels, with
  Scriptural subjects&mdash;among others the story of Joseph&mdash;and
  figures of saints richly carved in high relief. The plaques have borders
  with foliated ornaments, birds and animals, flowers and fruit, filling
  the spandrels.</p>

  <p>At Lincoln is a wooden chair, which appears to be <i>c.</i> 1300; it
  has recently been placed in the Chapter House and is now used by the
  bishop at diocesan synods (<a href="#page114">114</a>). It is possible
  that since several Parliaments met at Lincoln, between 1265 and 1327,
  that this may be the royal chair: it may well have been used also at the
  great trial of the Knights Templars, which was held in the Chapter House
  in 1310. It is only original up to the level of the arms; the lions, the
  back and the canopy are modern. <!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a

  <p>In Hereford cathedral is an ancient wooden chair, once coloured in red
  and gold; it is composed of fifty-three pieces; not counting the seat of
  two boards and the two circular heads in front; it has been variously
  ascribed to the twelfth or fourteenth century; but no doubt is Jacobean,
  belonging to the same class of chairs as those enumerated in the
  following paragraph (<a href="#page114">114</a>).<a name="NtA_67"
  href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> At Stanford Bishop church, Hereford, is
  a rude chair or settle, of oak without nails. It is said to have been
  traditionally called "Old Horstin's chair," and therefore has been
  supposed, very improbably, to be the identical chair seated on which St
  Augustine received the British bishops in Herefordshire <i>c.</i> 600
  <span class="sm">A.D.</span>, greatly exciting the ire of the irascible
  Celts by not rising from his seat to receive them. In the Canterbury
  Museum Dr Cox has recently deposited a mediæval chair believed to be of

  <p>A few examples remain of what are supposed to have been abbots'
  chairs. In the Bishop's Palace at Wells is preserved a chair of
  remarkable type, said to have been used by the Abbot <!-- Page 116
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>{116}</span>of
  Glastonbury. In the College, Manchester, is or was an ancient chair of
  the same baluster shape; and a very similar one formerly was to be seen
  in Agecroft Hall, Manchester. In the cottage at Zaandam, Holland, is a
  baluster chair, formerly used by Peter the Great. Another chair of this
  type, but of simpler form, is that once used by John Bunyan, and now
  preserved, together with his pulpit, in the meeting house of the
  Independent Congregation at Bedford. In the Victoria and Albert Museum is
  an arm-chair with balusters of turned ash. All these chairs are of
  seventeenth century date; no abbot of Glastonbury can have sat in the
  chair in the Bishop's Palace at Wells (<a href="#page115">115</a>, on the

  <p>A chair from Glastonbury, bearing an inscription, and in date
  <i>c.</i> 1530, is now in the chapel of the Bishop's Palace at Wells;
  modern copies of it may be seen in hundreds of churches. It is inscribed
  <i>Monachus Glastonie</i> and <i>Johannes Arthurus</i>; a similar chair
  was formerly in Southwick Priory, Hampshire (<a href="#page115">115</a>).
  An abbot's chair, reputed to have belonged originally to Peterborough
  cathedral, stands in the south chapel of Connington church, Hunts, where
  it is said to have been brought from the collegiate church of
  Fotheringhay, and is said to have been the last chair in which Mary,
  Queen of Scots, sat previous to her execution. From Little Dunmow priory
  came the chair now in Great Dunmow church, Essex; its trefoiled arcading
  shews that it was made in the thirteenth century. In it, up to 1907, were
  chaired the married couple "who had not repented them, sleeping or
  waking, of their marriage in a year and a day." The first recorded claim
  for the happy-marriage prize was made at the Priory in 1445 (<a

  <p>In Bishop's Cannings church, Wiltshire, is a remarkable seat believed
  to be a "carrel," or desk and seat, such as used to be employed by monks
  when at study in their cloister; it may have been brought from some
  monastic house. "It consists of an upright panel, with some fifteenth
  century moldings at the <!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page120"></a>{120}</span>top and sides; against this panel is
  constructed a seat, facing sideways, with a flooring, a back the ordinary
  height of a pew, a door facing the panel, and a sloping desk facing the
  seat." With this description may be compared that of the monastic carrels
  given in the <i>Rites of Durham</i>;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n ">

  <p>"In the north side of the cloister from the Corner over against the
  Church Door to the corner over against the Dorter door was all finely
  glazed from the height to the sole within a little of the ground into the
  cloister garth, and in every window three pews or carrels where every one
  of the old monks had his Carrel, several by himself, that when they had
  dined they did resort to that place of cloister, and there studied upon
  their books, every one in his carrel, all the afternoon unto evensong
  time; this was their exercise every day. All their pews or Carrels was
  all finely wainscotted and very close, all but the forepart, which had
  carved work that gave light in at the carrel doors of wain scot. And in
  every Carrel was a desk to lie their books on; and the Carrels was no
  greater than from one stanchion of the window to another."</p>

  <p>In St Paul's church, Jarrow, is a very rude seat known as the chair of
  the Venerable Bede; he was a monk of Jarrow, and died in 742; only the
  sides and seat and the crossbar at the top are original. Mr Mickethwaite
  was of opinion that it was originally a settle; and it seems hardly
  likely that the chair can have survived from the eighth century,
  especially as the monastery of Jarrow was repeatedly burnt by the Danes;
  but it is of an exceptionally hard oak, and bears marks of fire, and has
  had its present designation for several centuries.<a name="NtA_71"
  href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> It will be noticed that the standards
  have been whittled away by relic hunters (<a href="#page119">119</a>). At
  Lutterworth is a well-known chair; the tradition is that it was used by
  John Wyclif, and that he was smitten with paralysis while sitting in it
  hearing mass, on Holy Innocents' day, 1384, and was carried in it to the
  rectory hard by, where he died on the last day of that year. A brass
  plate on it records the tradition; but the chair is plainly Jacobean and
  of domestic origin; there is another chair in the chancel of exactly the
  same shape and pattern (<a href="#page120">120</a>). <!-- Page 123

  <p> At Kidderminster Baxter's chair is preserved; on it is the following
  inscription:&mdash;"Rev. R<sup>d</sup> Baxter born n<sup>r</sup>
  Shrewsbury in 1615 and died at London in 1691. Chaplain to King Charles
  II. Rev. T. Doolittle, M.A. S<sup>r</sup> H. Ashurst B<sup>t</sup>,
  Kidderminster, <span class="sm">A.</span> 1650 <span
  class="sm">D.</span>" Baxter speaks of Mr Thomas Doolittle, born in
  Kidderminster, as "a good schollar, a godly man, of an upright life and
  moderate Principles, and a very profitable serious Preacher." To Sir
  Henry Ashurst, Bart., Sylvester dedicated his <i>Reliquiae
  Baxterianae</i>, 1696. He also stood by Baxter in the day of his trial
  and distress, paid the fees for his six counsel, and when the trial
  before Judge Jeffries was over, led Baxter through the crowd, and
  conveyed him away in his coach. He was also Baxter's executor, and it is
  possible the chair may originally have belonged to him. At Beeston Regis,
  Norfolk, is a fine old seat, now used by the parish clerk (<a
  href="#page119">119</a>); it would seem to be of the period of the work
  at Balsham and elsewhere (<a href="#page3">3</a>). At Winchfield,
  Hampshire, is another old seat of rude and early design (<a
  href="#page116">116</a>).</p>

  <p>Stone seats are occasionally found. Where they are placed south of the
  altar, they are probably sedilia; but not when they are placed in the
  western bay or bays of the chancel or in the nave. At Barnack the remains
  of a stone seat were found on the west wall of the Pre-Conquest tower; it
  had formerly an oak seat and oak slabs on either side: a stone seat
  occurs also in the west wall of the nave of Old Radnor church. A stone
  seat is not uncommon in the western bays on the south side of chancels;
  the object of this is not clear; perhaps it was to provide a seat for the
  priest while reading his office; in later days, as we have seen, oak
  stalls were common in parish chancels, and the priest would read his
  office in one of these. Several examples occur. There is a rude example
  in the Pre-Conquest church of Corhampton, Hampshire. Others, probably
  <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page125"></a>{125}</span>of thirteenth century date, occur at
  Warlingham, Surrey, and Halsham and Sprotborough, Yorkshire. At Lenham,
  Kent, is one with solid stone arms, and with a cinquefoiled canopy of
  later date.</p>

  <p>Last, we have the Coronation chair at Westminster,<a name="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> which has a long, if somewhat
  unreliable history behind it. The stone beneath it is said to have been
  the one on which Jacob's head rested at Bethel; from whence it travelled
  to Egypt, and thence to Spain, Ireland and lastly Scotland. King Kenneth
  of Scotland had the following inscription engraved on it in Latin
  verse:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hgdq">"Ni fallat fatum, Scoti quocunque locatum</p>
      <p>Invenient lapidem regnare tenentur ibidem";</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>a prophecy curiously fulfilled on the accession of James I. to the
  English throne (<a href="#page121">121</a>). On the upper surface of the
  stone is a rectangular groove large enough to receive an inscribed plate.
  Edward I. found the stone in 1296 at Scone abbey, where the Scotch kings
  had always been crowned on it. He carried it to London, and in 1300
  Master Adam, the king's goldsmith, was working at a bronze chair to hold
  it. But when this was nearly <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page126"></a>{126}</span>finished, the king altered his mind and
  had a copy of it made in wood&mdash;the present chair&mdash;which cost
  100s., by Master Walter, the king's painter. The chair has lost the
  quatrefoils in front, and the lions are of recent date. It originally
  stood in the same position as a bishop's chair, <i>i.e.</i>, at the back
  of the High altar and in front of the shrine of Edward the Confessor, and
  facing to the west. It is made of oak, fastened together with pins; the
  surface was first covered over with the usual gesso; then gold was
  applied by means of white of egg, and burnished; then minute dots,
  forming diapers of foliage, beasts, birds, &amp;c., were pricked on the
  surface of the gold, taking care not to penetrate it, with a blunt
  instrument before the ground and gilding had lost their elasticity; a
  most tedious and delicate process. A second chair, modelled on the older
  one, was made on her coronation for Mary II., Queen of William III. It
  used to stand by the side of the king's chair, but has been moved to the
  easternmost recess of Henry VII.'s chapel. In Winchester cathedral is the
  chair which was used by Mary I. on her marriage with Philip of Spain,
  which was solemnised in the Lady chapel: it is now placed in Bishop
  Langton's chapel (<a href="#page122">122</a>). Very similar is a chair
  preserved in York Minster, which, owing to the shield attached in front,
  is probably not older than the time of Richard II.:<a name="NtA_73"
  href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> the cushion is stuffed, and covered
  with green velvet; the shield also is covered with leather, the upper
  part of which has been torn away, and the lines upon it are but slightly
  stamped. At Constance is shewn a similar chair of Martin V., who was
  elected Pope there in 1417.</p>

  <p>In addition to the above, chairs are often placed in the presbytery to
  the north of the altar. These were occupied by the preacher during
  morning or evening service, till his turn came to ascend the pulpit and
  deliver the sermon. Of these the greater number no doubt have been
  presented by the owner of some manor house or parsonage, or have been
  picked up in recent years in some second-hand furniture shop. This is
  probably the case with the interesting chair which is known to have been
  for nearly a century in the Mainwaring chapel of Higher Peover church,
  Cheshire; it bears not only the name, but the portrait and initials of
  the owner. The inscription is <span class="sm">DORATHY MAYNWARING</span>;
  she married Sir Richard Mainwaring of Ightfield, Salop, High Sheriff of
  that county in 1545. Most of the chair is older than her time; Dorothy
  seems to have had it put together of old bits of carving, adding her name
  and portrait, and the raven, the crest of her father, Sir Robert Corbet.
  She lived at Ightfield, and it was probably when that branch of the
  family became extinct that the chair was brought to Higher Peover church,
  and placed in the Mainwaring chapel. At the top are holes for holding
  sconces in which tapers would be placed (<a href="#page123">123</a>).

  <p>At Penshurst there used to be a chair with a bust on the inner panel
  of the back; the tradition was that it belonged to Sir Philip Sidney.<a
  name="NtA_74" href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> At Puddletown, Dorset, a
  chair has been in the chancel for very many years; it is of Elizabethan
  date, and was probably brought from some hall or manor house. "The tall
  narrow back, the broadening seat, the vertically straight, but
  horizontally angled arms are those of the French caqueteure type rarely
  seen in England. The strap carving of the back is of the best; while the
  twin greyhounds with averted heads that fit the curved top of the chair
  no doubt have reference to the original owner" (<a
  href="#page124">124</a>).<a name="NtA_75"
  href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> At Upton, near Castor, there <!-- Page
  129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>{129}</span>are two
  chairs in the chancel; on one of which is inscribed "<span
  class="sm">A.D.</span> 1700&mdash;Joane Browne&mdash;Want Not." The other
  has the initials J. D.; the Doves were Lords of the Manor at that time
  (<a href="#page130">130</a>).<a name="NtA_76"
  href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> In Redenhall church, Norfolk, is one of
  two chairs brought there from Canterbury cathedral by Archbishop Sancroft
  on his expulsion from the see in 1615; it is of a curious pattern common
  in the latter part of the seventeenth century, in which the back is
  hinged and can be turned over to convert the chair into a table.
  Archbishop Sancroft is buried at Redenhall, which, by the way, possesses
  perhaps the finest church tower of any village in England and an
  exceptionally fine ring of ancient bells. The other chair is kept at
  Gawdy Hall, the seat of the Sancrofts (<a href="#page125">125</a>).</p>

  <p>In many cases the chair is a composite product, made up of fragments
  of screens, bench ends and the like; this seems to be the case with the
  chairs in the churches of Bridford, Devon, and Othery, Somerset; that at
  Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, appears to be put together out of the
  fragments of a screen (<a href="#page126">126</a>). In the Chapter House
  of Gloucester cathedral are two chairs, on the inner panels of the back
  of which are carved "The Last Supper" and "The Ascension" respectively;
  the panels were presented in the time of Dean Law, and, provided with a
  framework, now form part of two chairs.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Combmartin</p>
  </div>

  <p>Where, however, the chair has a representation of some ecclesiastical
  subject, the presumption is that it was made for the church in which it
  is placed. In Cartmel Priory church is a fine chair on the back of which
  is represented the Resurrection; below are seen the Roman soldiers;
  above, Christ shews the wounds in His hands (<a href="#page127">127</a>).
  At Sanderstead, Surrey, Abraham <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page130"></a>{130}</span>with uplifted sword is about to slay
  Isaac; on the right is shewn the ram, on the left an angel. The same
  subject appears, better carved, on the back of one of two chairs brought
  from a church in Suffolk, now pulled down; on the other chair is a
  representation of what looks like the Temptation (<a
  href="#page128">128</a>). In Halsall church, Lancashire, are two
  beautiful chairs with the initials IHS; beneath them is a scroll on which
  is inscribed <i>Ecce quomodo amabat</i> (<a href="#page128">128</a>). In
  the Victoria and Albert Museum is a similar "winged" chair, which bears
  the initials IPI and the date 1670. In the chancel of Combmartin church,
  Devon, is a mahogany chair with wheat and grapes, apparently referring to
  the sacramental bread and wine; it had been for many years in the family
  of the present incumbent, Rev. F. W. Jones, and was presented by him to
  the church; it is possible that it was originally made for a church (<a

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">SOME PRESS NOTICES</p>

  <p><i>Builder.</i>&mdash;"When we look at the detailed photographs we
  realise the richness of the field which Mr Bond has traversed, and
  congratulate him on the choice of his subject. His method is one of
  singular thoroughness from the ecclesiological standpoint."</p>

  <p><i>Journal of the Architectural Association.</i>&mdash;"As a record of
  the screens remaining in our churches it cannot be valued too highly. No
  book till now has brought such a number together, or traced their
  development in so full and interesting a manner.... A most delightful
  book."</p>

  <p><i>Builders' Journal.</i>&mdash;"The author may be congratulated on
  the production of a book which, in text as well as in illustrations, is
  of striking and inexhaustible interest; it is the kind of book to which
  one returns again and again, in the assurance of renewed and increased
  pleasure at each reperusal."</p>

  <p><i>Tablet.</i>&mdash;"The numerous excellent illustrations are of the
  greatest interest, and form a veritable surprise as to the beauty and
  variety of the treatment which our forefathers lavished upon the rood
  screen."</p>

  <p><i>British Weekly.</i>&mdash;"The book abounds with admirable
  illustrations of these beautiful works of art, so perfect even in the
  minute details that any one interested in the art of woodcarving could
  reproduce the designs with ease from the excellent photographs which
  occur on almost every page. There is also a series of 'measured drawings'
  of great beauty and interest."</p>

  <p><i>New York Nation.</i>&mdash;"It is not easy to praise too highly the
  simple and effective presentation of the subject and the interest of the
  book to all persons who care for ecclesiology or for decorative art."</p>

  <p><i>Bibliophile.</i>&mdash;"This excellent book is a sign of the times;
  of the reawakened interest in the beautiful and historic.... A model of
  scholarly compression. Of the finely produced illustrations it is
  difficult to speak in too high terms of praise."</p>

  <p><i>Daily Graphic.</i>&mdash;"Mr Bond has produced a work on our
  ecclesiastical screens and galleries which, like his larger work on the
  'Gothic Architecture of England,' is in the first degree masterly. His
  knowledge of his subject, exact and comprehensive, is compressed into a
  minimum amount of space, and illustrated by a series of photographs and
  measured drawings which render the work of permanent value."</p>

  <p><i>Bulletin Monumental.</i>&mdash;"Après avoir analysé, aussi
  exactement que possible, l'intéressant étude de M. Bond, nous devons le
  féliciter de nous avoir donné ce complément si utile à son grand
  ouvrage."</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">SOME PRESS NOTICES</p>

  <p><i>Guardian.</i>&mdash;"Mr Bond is so well known by his monumental
  work on 'Gothic Architecture in England,' and by his beautiful book on
  'Screens and Galleries,' that his name alone is a sufficient guarantee
  for this new volume on 'Fonts and Font Covers,' the most complete and
  thorough that has yet appeared."</p>

  <p><i>Church Times.</i>&mdash;"The finest collection of illustrations of
  fonts and font covers yet attempted.... A real delight to the
  ecclesiologist."</p>

  <p><i>Commonwealth.</i>&mdash;"A sumptuous monograph on a very
  interesting subject; complete and thorough."</p>

  <p><i>Church Quarterly Review.</i>&mdash;"It is most delightful, not only
  to indulge in a serious perusal of this volume, but to turn over its
  pages again and again, always sure to find within half a minute some
  beautiful illustration or some illuminating remark."</p>

  <p><i>Irish Builder.</i>&mdash;"This book on 'Fonts and Font Covers' is a
  most valuable contribution to mediæval study, put together in masterly
  fashion, with deep knowledge and love of the subject."</p>

  <p><i>Westminster Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Every one interested in church
  architecture and sculpture will feel almost as much surprise as delight
  in Mr Bond's attractive volume on 'Fonts and Font Covers.' The wealth of
  illustrations and variety of interest are truly astonishing."</p>

  <p><i>Journal of the Society of Architects.</i>&mdash;"The book is a
  monument of painstaking labour and monumental research; its
  classification is most admirable. The whole subject is treated in a
  masterly way with perfect sequence and a thorough appreciation of the
  many sources of development; the illustrations, too, are thoroughly
  representative. To many the book will come as a revelation. We all
  recognise that the fonts are essential, and in many cases beautiful and
  interesting features in our ancient churches, but few can have
  anticipated the extraordinary wealth of detail which they exhibit when
  the photographs of all the best of them are collected together in a
  single volume."</p>

  <p><i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;"Mr Francis Bond's book carefully included in
  one's luggage enables one, with no specialist's knowledge postulated, to
  pursue to a most profitable end one of the most interesting, almost, we
  could say, romantic, branches of ecclesiastical architecture.... This
  book, owing to its scholarship and thoroughness in letterpress and
  illustrations, will doubtless be classic; in all its methods it strikes
  us as admirable. The bibliography and the indexes are beyond praise."</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">SOME PRESS NOTICES</p>

  <p><i>Guardian.</i>&mdash;"There is probably no better brief handbook. Mr
  Bond's qualifications for the task are beyond question. By the use of
  varied type, ingenious arrangement, and excellent tone-blocks and plans,
  the book attains a high standard of lucidity as well as of accuracy."</p>

  <p><i>Building News.</i>&mdash;"This little work is characterised by its
  terseness, directness, and practical treatment. A carefully compiled and
  scholarly guide-book."</p>

  <p><i>Architect.</i>&mdash;"This book will excellently and admirably
  fulfil its purpose.... A splendid itinerary, in which almost every inch
  of the way is made to speak of its historical connections."</p>

  <p><i>Birmingham Daily Post.</i>&mdash;"Concise, informative, reliable,
  and admirably illustrated."</p>

  <p><i>Western Morning News.</i>&mdash;"By his key plan and very clear
  directions as to where to find the numerous side chapels, historic
  monuments, and other objects of interest, Mr Bond makes it possible for a
  visitor to find his way round the building at his leisure. It refreshes
  one's knowledge of English history, and is supplemented by thirty-two
  excellent plates, which by themselves are worth the shilling charged for
  it."</p>

  <p><i>Scotsman.</i>&mdash;"A more complete and dependable guide to the
  National Pantheon could not be desired."</p>

  <p><i>Architectural Review.</i>&mdash;"This is an excellent little
  text-book. Mr Bond is to be congratulated in having introduced into it an
  interesting element of history. The notes in small print should make the
  visit to the Abbey both more profitable and more interesting. The key
  plan and the numerous small plans are extremely clear and easily read.
  The information given is concise and to the point, and a word of special
  praise must be given to the plates at the end; the subjects of these are
  well chosen and are illustrated by very good photographs."</p>

  <p><i>Antiquary.</i>&mdash;"This little book, strongly bound in linen
  boards, gives concisely and clearly all the information the ordinary
  visitor is likely to require. Cheap, well arranged, well printed,
  abundantly illustrated and well indexed, this handy book, which is light
  and 'pocketable,' is the best possible companion for which a visitor to
  our noble Abbey can wish; it is an ideal guide."</p>

  <p><i>Saturday Review.</i>&mdash;"Mr Bond leaves us more than ever proud
  of what is left to us of the stately Benedictine house of God, which is
  to the entire English-speaking world a common bond and home."</p>

  <p><i>Antiquary.</i>&mdash;"It has a wealth of capital illustrations, is
  preceded by a bibliography, and is supplied with good indexes to both
  illustrations and text."</p>

  <p><i>Journal des Savants.</i>&mdash;"Certains clichés, comme ceux des
  voûtes, des tombeaux et de quelques détails de sculpture sont de
  véritables tours de force. Le choix des illustrations est très heureux,
  comme d'ailleurs dans les autres ouvrages de M. Bond."</p>

  pertains to ecclesiology to excellent service in his latest book on
  Misericords."</p>

  comprehensively with the great variety of carvings on misericords."</p>

  and at the same time most learned volumes that a reader would happen upon
  in a lifetime."</p>

  illustrations are worthy of all praise."</p>

  only a valuable technical monograph, but also an important contribution
  to the history of social life and thought in the Middle Ages. Mr Bond's
  treatment of the subject is exceptionally charming and successful. The
  general excellence of the book is great."</p>

  <p><i>Outlook.</i>&mdash;"Many there must be to whom Mr Bond's new book
  will be welcome. Into all the details of this varied and most puzzling
  subject he goes with thoroughness and a pleasant humour. The bibliography
  and indexes, as usual in Mr Bond's work, are admirable."</p>
